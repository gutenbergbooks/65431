<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>The life story of Joan of Arc, as told in
this volume, closely follows the historical
facts as well as the official records bearing
upon her trial and burning for &ldquo;heresy,
relapse, apostasy, and idolatry.&rdquo; It naturally divides
into two parts. First, the simple pastoral
life of the shepherd maiden of Domremy, which is
charmingly portrayed; the visions of her favorite
saints; the heavenly voices which commissioned her
to raise the English siege of Orleans and crown the
Dauphin; her touching farewell to her home; and,
secondly, the part she played as the Maid of Orleans
in the stirring events of the field; the victories
which she achieved over the English and their Burgundian
allies; the raising of the siege; the coronation
of the ungrateful Dauphin at Rheims; her
fatal mistake in remaining in his service after her
mission was accomplished; her capture at Compi&egrave;gne;
her infamous sale to the English by Burgundy;
her more infamous trial by the corrupt and
execrable Cauchon; and her cruel martyrdom at the
stake. Another story, the abduction of Marie of
Chafleur, her rescue by Jean Renault, and their final
happiness, is closely interwoven with the movement
of the main story, and serves to lighten up the closing
chapters. This episode is pure romance of an
exciting nature; but the life of the Maid of Orleans
is a remarkably faithful historical picture, which is
all the more vivid because the characters are real.
In this respect it resembles nearly all the volumes
in the numerous German &ldquo;libraries for youth.&rdquo;
They are stories of real lives, concisely, charmingly,
and honestly told, and adhere so closely to fact
that the reader forms something like an intimate
personal acquaintance with the characters they
introduce.</p>

<h2>The Maid of Orleans</h2>
<h2 id="c1"><span class="h2line1">Chapter I</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Fairy Tree</span></h2>
<p>As the traveller, descending the valley from
Neufch&acirc;teau, approaches the village of
Domremy,<a class="fn" id="fr_1" href="#fn_1">[1]</a> he will observe at his right
upon an eminence of the nearest range
of hills a stately chestnut-tree, its lower branches
hung with wreaths of flowers, some fresh, some fading.
If he does not mind a little fatigue and climbs
to this spot, he will be richly rewarded for his exertions.
The tree in itself is a sufficient compensation
for his efforts, for who does not contemplate with
admiration such a work of nature? Who does not
listen with rapture to the gentle rustle of its leaves
and find rest in its cool shade? But this tree has
a still stronger attraction for those who believe its
story. Ofttimes in the twilight they see happy
sprites dancing round it with joyous faces, and the
soft rustling of its leaves they declare is celestial
whispers, for it is given to them to understand
heavenly speech.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>This tree is the &ldquo;Fairy Tree.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_2" href="#fn_2">[2]</a></p>
<p>The outlook from this spot will still further repay
the traveller. A beautiful valley spreads out before
him, bounded on either side by the forest-crowned
heights of Argonne and Ardennes, between which
the Meuse<a class="fn" id="fr_3" href="#fn_3">[3]</a>
winds its silvery way. Numerous villages
dot these heights and are sprinkled here and
there along the lower pasture-land. North and
south gleam the towers of Neufch&acirc;teau and
Vaucouleurs.<a class="fn" id="fr_4" href="#fn_4">[4]</a>
The nearest, and at the same time most
pleasant of these villages, is Domremy, whose cottages,
embowered in greenery, cluster about the little
church of Saint Margaret. Many herds of cattle
and sheep are feeding in the pastures between fields
luxuriant with growing crops. Looking back, the
eye catches the dusky summits of the Bois de
Ch&ecirc;ne,<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a> and at the crossroad leading thither stands
the chapel of Saint Catherine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<p>Between the chapel and the Fairy Tree, and
somewhat nearer the latter, sparkles a bubbling
spring whose curative powers were believed in by
those of pious faith in the olden times.</p>
<p>Thus the scene appears under pleasant skies.
But when the temperature suddenly changes, and
the cold air rushes down into the valley, its mists
are driven and scattered among the mountainous
defiles. At such times superstitious villagers believe
they see the fairies dancing round the tree,
and even the saints of heaven in the wavering shapes
of the mist.</p>
<p>Among the mysterious spots which have invested
the neighborhood of Domremy with such fame and
sacredness Bois de Ch&ecirc;ne is not the least famous.
One cannot enter its dark recesses without that
peculiar feeling of awe which inspires a solitary
wanderer in the presence of nature&rsquo;s grandeurs,&mdash;a
feeling which inevitably fills the mind of a superstitious
person with a bewildering array of supernatural
fancies. It was from this very forest that
Merlin the wizard predicted the deliverer of France
would come.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_14">14</div>
<p>Think of a child of susceptible and fanciful nature,
fed upon nursery tales full of superstitions, a
child passionately fond of solitary reveries and fervent
appeals to the saints, growing up in such an
environment! Is it remarkable that such a child
should see marvels on the earth and in the air,
and the saints themselves in bodily image, and that
she should hear their voices and listen devoutly to
angelic music in the celestial regions?</p>
<p>Just such a child as this sat under the Fairy Tree
on a beautiful spring morning in the year 1424.<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a>
She was a maiden of twelve years, and was tending
a little flock of sheep grazing on the hillside. Even
the casual observer would have noticed her striking
appearance, for while the other girls were frolicking
in the meadow below her, she sat leaning against
the tree, gazing fixedly into space, and evidently
thinking of other things than dance, and sport, and
herds. Looking more closely into her lovely oval
face and observing its transparent tints and delicate
features, the question would at once suggest itself&mdash;How
did such a slight, ethereal creature happen
among the children of peasants? Those wonderful
eyes did not merely reveal the self-unconsciousness
of the visionary and the rapture of supernatural
contemplation. They were clear mirrors of the
heart, reflecting its inmost recesses and depths.
That heart was the heart of an angel, the heart of a
child so innocent it was impossible not to love her
and sympathize with her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<p>As she sat there, a flock of little birds flew to the
tree, filling the air with the music of their songs.
Apparently she did not notice them, for she neither
moved nor changed the expression of her face.
They fluttered down from the tree and hopped
about the dreamer, approaching her more and more
nearly, until at last some of them lit on her head
and shoulder. Now for the first time she was
conscious of her little guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; she exclaimed in a soft melodious voice.
&ldquo;You are here and I did not know it.&rdquo; She
quickly opened a little basket standing near her,
sprinkled some crumbs upon the ground, and
watched with childish delight the liveliness of her
tiny companions. Her pleasure, however, was soon
marred by a saucy and envious fellow in the little
crowd, who pecked his neighbor. Chirping sorrowfully,
the victim flew to the maiden&rsquo;s feet.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! alas! poor little bird!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
the tears coming into her eyes. She took the little
fellow in her lap and caressed him. &ldquo;Wait, now,
thou envious &lsquo;wolf,&rsquo;&rdquo; she said, addressing the offender.
&ldquo;Did I not scatter crumbs enough for you
all? And did you not know I would have doubled
the amount if that had not been sufficient? You
deserve to be punished for your greediness. Now
you shall see how finely this poor little fellow will
fare at his own table.&rdquo; Thereupon she filled her lap
from the basket, and the little one ate with a relish,
while the &ldquo;wolf&rdquo; was not allowed to come near the
table, much as he wished to. Suddenly the flock
rose and flew into the branches of the tree in manifest
alarm. Her sheep, which had been feeding
below her, rushed up the hill as fast as they could,
and closely huddled together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is the matter?&rdquo; cried the maiden, as she
cast a hasty glance at the flying herd. &ldquo;What has
driven you away from the meadow in such fright?
Holy Catherine! the cruel wolf must be lurking on
the edge of the wood.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_17">17</div>
<p>She quickly sprang up, seized her crook, and
flew to the Bois de Ch&ecirc;ne, where a wolf was really
lying in wait. One who had seen her then would
hardly have recognized the gentle maiden, the
dreamer of a moment before, in this resolute heroine,
her eyes flashing with courage. Wonderful to
relate, the beast fled from her. For an instant it
crouched, ready to spring upon her, and then slunk
away into the forest. Thereupon the little heroine
went to the neighboring chapel, knelt before the
image of Saint Catherine, and poured out the thankfulness
of her heart in long and fervent prayers. It
was her childish belief that her patron saint had
performed a miracle. She did not know that the
beasts of the wood can be intimidated by the firmness
and courage of a fearless person&rsquo;s glance, and
that even the lion himself will not attack such a
person unless he is in a frenzy of rage.</p>
<p>As the little one left the chapel the spiritual
illumination which irradiated her face when she sat
dreaming under the Fairy Tree again shone in
her beautiful eyes. Her route led her to the
miraculous spring.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a>
The fresh green of the bushes
and turf allured her. She threw herself down, and
soon was lulled by the gentle plashing of the water
into sweet fancies. For a long time she failed to
observe that she had companions who had come
there to drink,&mdash;a doe and fawns, who fearlessly
approached and drank the clear water undisturbed.
After they had quenched their thirst, the fawns
stood watching the dreamer with their intelligent
little eyes as if they were awaiting friendly recognition
from an old acquaintance. Not receiving it,
they sported frolicsomely around her. Suddenly
the charming scene was interrupted. The animals
tossed up their heads, listened intently, and then, as
if at a word of command, galloped away to the forest.
A bevy of simple, joyous, sun-browned shepherdesses
came running toward her from the meadow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_18">18</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joan, Joan,&rdquo; cried one, &ldquo;where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The maiden rose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said the one just speaking, &ldquo;she has been
listening again to the murmurs of the spring. Just
see how wondrously her eyes glisten!&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this all of them came up and gazed with a
kind of awe at the strange maiden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you wish?&rdquo; said Joan, gently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have made a wager,&rdquo; replied the former
speaker. &ldquo;See this beautiful wreath, Joan. After
we had woven it we decided it should go to
the winner in a race to the Fairy Tree. Agnes
boasted it would be hers. Margot was just as sure
that she would win it. &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said I; &lsquo;if Joan were
only here you would not talk this way!&rsquo; &lsquo;And
why not?&rsquo; said Agnes. &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;Saint
Catherine always helps her.&rsquo; &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; interposed Margot,
&lsquo;I will find Joan and she also shall race.&rsquo;
Then I said, &lsquo;We will all search for Joan.&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo;
all shouted, &lsquo;let us find Joan!&rsquo; And here we are.
Here is the wreath, and there is the Fairy Tree.
Will you run?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan made no reply. She stood absorbed in
devotion, and prayed: &ldquo;Holy Catherine, give me
the victory, not for my sake, but for thy honor.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>&ldquo;Joan, do you not hear us?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I am ready.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Gleefully the maidens formed a line. &ldquo;One,
two, three,&rdquo; a clear voice counted, and all ran up
the hillside. In a few seconds the line was zig-zag,
with Agnes, Margot, and Joan in the lead. Most
of the others gave up the race and followed slowly
on, watching the three in eager suspense. Soon,
however, they noticed there was one in the lead,
for the other two had perceptibly fallen back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you Joan would win?&rdquo; said the
one who had first spoken.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But there is some witchcraft about it,&rdquo; said her
neighbor. &ldquo;Look at her, look! Holy Margaret!
Her feet do not touch the ground.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is so,&rdquo; all said, as they crossed themselves.
&ldquo;She is flying through the air.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It really seemed as if Joan were flying. The
mist, the fast-gathering twilight, and the distance
created such an ocular illusion that any superstitious
spectator would have sworn she was flying.
All hurried to the tree, under whose branches the
victor was not standing, but devoutly kneeling. The
joyous crowd surrounded her, and no feeling of
envy clouded their joy as they placed the wreath
upon her fair head. As the night was now fast coming
on, the girls went homewards with the flocks.
They were all from the village of Domremy.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_20">20</div>
<p>Joan found Jacques, her father, Pierre, her brother,
and Duram Laxart, her uncle, engaged in earnest
conversation with a stranger in the square in front
of the church. A few words which she overheard
aroused her curiosity, and she approached the group
and listened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I bid you repent,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;lest
the wrath of Heaven be visited upon you, for
all the misfortunes of this land are divine punishments
for the sins of the Court and the King&rsquo;s
kindred.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, oh, holy father,&rdquo; said one, &ldquo;that would
be very sad.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by that, my son?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean it would be very sad for Heaven to punish
poor people who have done no wrong, for the
wrongdoings of the Court.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go home, thou son of Belial who doubtest that
which the Spirit reveals to thee through my lips.
Shut thyself up in thy chamber, and three times
repeat seven paternosters, that thy soul may be
released from the bonds of doubt, for doubt is the
work of the devil, who is already stretching out his
claws to seize thee.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, holy father&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet, Gamoche,&rdquo; interposed another villager.
&ldquo;Do not interrupt the holy father. He
will explain it all to us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; cried the others, &ldquo;he will explain
everything.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, then, listen to me, children,&rdquo; resumed the
stranger. &ldquo;But, holy Mother of God, where shall
I begin? The list of the sins of this Court is so
long that if I should go back a century, even then
it would not be the beginning. I will confine myself
to the recent ones, which must be more or less
familiar to you all. Have you heard about the
last King, Charles the Sixth?&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_8" href="#fn_8">[8]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should we not have heard? He died
insane only two years ago.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, insane. He had a few lucid moments after
1392, in which he recognized in some measure the
profligacy of the administration. The whole royal
family, with but few exceptions, acted as if they
were insane. First of all, there was the Queen, the
notorious Isabella of Bavaria, who was as much a
stranger to the nobility of human nature as she was
to the divine. Her every purpose and act had no
higher motive than the gratification of her own
desires and the discovery how to accomplish them.
It would have mattered nothing to her if a sea of
blood had been shed, if only her interests were advanced.
There was the Duke Louis of Orleans,<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a>
brother of the insane King, who pandered to Isabella&rsquo;s
profligacy and lust of power, finally seized
the reins of sovereignty, and plunged the state into
direst confusion. There were the King&rsquo;s uncles,
the dukes of Bourbon, Berry, Burgundy, and Anjou,
all alike avaricious and ambitious for power, who
lashed the Duke of Orleans and the King with the
scourge of war, murdered their subjects, and ravaged
the country. Then came numerous factions which
contended with one another, one for this, and one
for that, and finally almost countless great and little
lords, robber barons, who, pretending to espouse the
cause of one party, harried the districts of others,
leaving a trail of pillage and blood. To complete
the burden of wretchedness, King Henry the Fifth
sent his Englishmen, those hereditary enemies of
France, across the Channel. In alliance with the
turbulent dukes, particularly those of Burgundy
and Brittany, they advanced victorious, captured
one place after another, and at last even Rouen and
Paris, so that few provinces were left to the unfortunate
King. Frightful confusion followed when
this King died in 1422. Henry the Fifth, to be sure,
died in the same year, but his field marshal, the
Duke of Bedford, guardian of young Henry the
Sixth,<a class="fn" id="fr_10" href="#fn_10">[10]</a> did not abandon the field. The infamous
treaty of Troyes gave him the semblance of right.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>&ldquo;How so, holy father?&rdquo; interposed one of the
villagers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; replied another. &ldquo;You ought to
have known that Queen Isabella, out of hate and
revenge against her youngest son Charles, who,
after the death of his brother the Dauphin, was
crown prince, concluded that treaty with England
whereby the French royal family was barred from
the succession and the King of England was declared
successor of Charles the Sixth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the disgrace! Oh, the shame!&rdquo; several
exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this poor Dauphin,&rdquo; continued the former
speaker, &ldquo;spent a joyless youth, in which his unnatural
mother often forced him as well as his father to
suffer the pangs of hunger; and yet, poor, weak,
and throneless as he is, he is still ready to struggle
for that throne which is his birthright as Charles
the Seventh. Is this not so, holy father?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, certainly, God&rsquo;s pity,&rdquo; replied the
stranger. &ldquo;He should rule by his own and by
divine right. The treaty of Troyes cannot prevent
it. But where is the hero who will lead him
to coronation at Rheims? Alas, only miraculous
interposition can save him from ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Saint Catherine,&rdquo; sighed a gentle voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Joan!&rdquo; exclaimed Jacques, as he recognized his
daughter, &ldquo;what are you doing here? Go home.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet, father Jacques,&rdquo; said the stranger.
&ldquo;Let her stay. Do you not know that the prayers
from a pure child&rsquo;s heart are heard by the dear
saints? And,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I have never seen eyes
so full of innocence and piety as hers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied Jacques, &ldquo;of what use are the
prayers of a child when the whole country lies
helpless?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you also an unbeliever?&rdquo; replied the
stranger. &ldquo;Know you not that the great God can
manifest Himself in a little child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>These were the last words of the conversation
which Joan heard. She suddenly disappeared, but
she did not go home. She wended her way to the
church, which was always open. Never had her
heart been so troubled and full of strange longings,
never had she been so powerfully moved to hold
communion with her saint. It was not so much
the desire to make a votive offering of her wreath
as it was the unspeakable sorrow of the fatherland
and the wretched plight of the poor Dauphin that
urged her to this sacred spot. And was this strange?
If her sympathetic nature made her shed tears over
the slight suffering of a bird, how much more would
it force her to weep over the story of universal misfortune
which she had just heard! Why should
not the courage with which she had defended her
sheep from the wolf display itself now even more
decidedly? And why should she not believe in her
very soul that her favorite saint would perform a
miracle of rescue?</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, were I only a man!&rdquo; she sighed from the
depth of her heart. &ldquo;Oh that I could clothe my
limbs in armor and wield the sword for the right!
I would ask for nothing better in life. No sacrifice
would be too great to accomplish it. Then,
surely, the beloved saints would not refuse to help
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In such a spirit she entered the sacred house. It
was empty. The shadows of evening, mingling with
the clouds of incense smoke which still lingered in
the church, were intensified by the feeble light of a
small lamp. She thrilled with sacred awe as she
advanced through the mysterious gloom. In her
exalted mood it seemed to her that Saint Catherine
smiled, as with trembling hand she placed the wreath
upon her altar. In transports of sorrow and gratitude,
of divine trust, and of overwhelming desire
for action, she knelt at the altar, and her soul
ascended to the celestial abodes. She knew no
prayers except the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer, the Credo, and
the Ave Maria, but the more she repeated them the
more completely was she spiritually absorbed.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<p>Thus little by little she sank into that species of
ecstasy in which the ordinary spiritual functions are
suspended and there remain only the sacred feeling
of heavenly contemplation and the free play of the
fancy. It is a condition which differs from actual
dreaming only in its danger, for there is danger
that this ecstatic feeling once aroused may become
real, and its possessor may behold illusive pictures
of the fancy. The enthusiast may believe
he sees real objects and hears actual voices. He
may believe them to be messages from heaven,
never asking himself whether such fancies will stand
the test of reason. Because of ecstasies like these,
deeds have been committed which have darkened
the page of history with everlasting shame. But
when these ecstasies arise from exalted moral ideas
they may achieve results which are far beyond mere
human strength and secure imperishable fame for
the enthusiast.</p>
<p>Thus it was with this simple child praying at the
altar. In her ecstatic fancy she saw the roof of the
church open, and her favorite Saints Catherine and
Margaret floating down through the clouds of incense.
She heard them saying, &ldquo;Keep thy heart
unsullied, Joan, for Heaven has chosen thee as the
champion of France.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_27">27</div>
<p>The vision disappeared. The dream was over.
But in that instant the career of this child was
determined. She was the subsequent Maid of
Orleans.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c2"><span class="h2line1">Chapter II</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Dauphin and La Hire</span></h2>
<p>By the storm of an April day in the year
1428, four years after the events related
in the preceding chapter, a man was detained
at home in the castle of Chinon.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a>
His costume showed that he was of the highest rank,
and the apartment also was furnished in a style of
princely luxury. As it was apparent, however, that
these luxurious surroundings were the survivals of
an older period, evidently the present occupant of
the castle either did not care to improve them or
could not afford to do it. As a matter of fact the
shabbiness of his own costume favored the latter
inference. The morose expression of his face,
which had but little that was attractive in it, deepened
this impression. Nothing about it indicated
any higher ambition than the gratification of his
physical desires. His appearance gave the impression
that he was at least thirty-five years of age, but
in reality he was only twenty-six. This man was
the Dauphin of France, afterwards King Charles the
Seventh.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_29">29</div>
<p>Before him stood a young and beautiful woman,
whose face was in striking contrast with his. A
dignified royal presence, eyes flashing with spirit
and resolution, womanly gentleness and kindness,&mdash;such
were the characteristics portrayed in her beautiful
countenance. Some of its lines indicated troubles
of the heart, but her present trouble was of another
kind.</p>
<p>This lady was Marie of Anjou, the proud consort
of the Dauphin. They were both standing, for in
the excitement of their conversation they had evidently
risen from their seats.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, this wretchedness!&rdquo; she moaned. &ldquo;Beautiful
France desolate! The luxurious fields of the
Loire laid waste! The poor people killed or fugitives
in the forests! Townsmen in servitude or in
continual fear of a victorious enemy! And you!
What are you doing?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, I? Who laments all this more than I?
Who has to suffer from it more than I? Am I
not growing poorer every day because of it? I am
afraid I shall not have even an ordinary dinner
to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>He hastily rang a silver bell, and a servant entered.
&ldquo;Jacques, go to the cook and ask him what he has
for dinner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Contempt and deep sorrow were pictured on
Marie&rsquo;s face, but she quickly mastered her anger.
&ldquo;Certainly, my husband, you have to suffer,&rdquo; said
she, &ldquo;but what kind of a king would he be who
did not feel the sufferings of his people a thousand-fold?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! I feel my poverty above everything else.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what necessity is there for your poverty?
Do you not know that your poverty will disappear
on the day when you overcome the enemy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I overcome the enemy! God help me! I
need what few mercenaries I have to forage for the
kitchen. Raise fresh troops! How can I do it?
What little gold there is in my treasury is already
pledged. I overcome the enemy! Ha, ha, ha!
they already hold nearly all of France. La Hire<a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a>
told me to-day that Count Salisbury is before
Orleans, and is besieging the city. When Orleans
falls, I must fly from here. Then what? I shall
end by being a beggar.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_31">31</div>
<p>&ldquo;You will not if you pluck up courage and remember
that when the necessity is the greatest, divine
aid is nearest, and that it is more glorious and more
worthy of a king to be vanquished in battle than to
be ruined by inglorious indolence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! I will do neither the one nor the other.
I will live and enjoy myself. That will compensate
me for what I lacked in the hungry days of my
youth. I will make terms with the English. They
may have everything else if they will only leave me
Languedoc.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a>
I can live there in a manner that
suits my income.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame! shame! what is this I hear?&rdquo; exclaimed
Marie. &ldquo;Are you a Valois? Does royal blood flow
in your veins? Do you not blush to utter such
words? Oh, my husband, do whatever else you wish,
but save France and me from such shame.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, all is not over yet at Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even if it fall, and if all seem lost, even
then do not make such a shameful agreement.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words the noble lady retired. The
moral indignation of her manner and her words appeared
to make some impression upon the Dauphin.
He buried his face in his hands, and was absorbed
in thought&mdash;as far as he was capable of thinking.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_32">32</div>
<p>While thus engaged, an arras door opened behind
him, revealing the charming little curly head of a
girl of eighteen or nineteen years. No one could
have seen that exquisite figure moving along with
such easy and consummate grace without confessing
he had never before seen such exquisite beauty and
fascinating manner. Her charm appeared not only
in her beautiful figure, but also in the gracious
expression which characterized her personality and
radiated from her countenance.</p>
<p>This maiden was the famous Agnes Sorel,<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a>
the favorite of Charles the Seventh, who, as history relates,
was conspicuous for her womanly tenderness,
and who always used her influence over the King for
noble purposes and never for personal ends.</p>
<p>The Dauphin was not aware of her presence until
he felt the light touch of her hand upon his shoulder.
The sight of her was magical in its effect. His face
lightened up, and all traces of dejection disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Agnes? Now everything is all right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has been wrong?&rdquo; she asked most tenderly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Marie has been here. She has made my head
ache and has nearly ruined my appetite. But&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; interrupted Agnes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? You know all about it? Who could
have told you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No one told me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you have been eavesdropping. Ah, ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had to. I could not go back, and of course I
was not permitted to enter.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_33">33</div>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! Never mind. It is all right, just the
same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Your Majesty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I share the anxiety and trouble of your proud
consort.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense! You ought not to be troubled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all the saints, Your Majesty, I shall be inconsolable
and unhappy if you do not abandon
your decision. I should be ashamed to serve a
prince who can so easily renounce his rights and
his dignities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well, I will consider the matter. Will
that satisfy you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, sire. You must promise me that you
will not think again of that hateful scheme. Will you
not for my sake?&rdquo; Thereupon she triumphantly
and gracefully pirouetted about the apartment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Agnes, I take back my word,&rdquo; cried the
Dauphin.</p>
<p>This made her all the happier, and she continued
her dance, singing this accompaniment:&mdash;</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;Eio, eio, eio, no,</p>
<p class="t0">He cannot be a King</p>
<p class="t0">Who does not keep his word!</p>
<p class="t0">Eio, eio, eio, O,</p>
<p class="t0">This one here&mdash;he is not such,</p>
<p class="t0">No, no, no, oh, no.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<p>With the last word she suddenly disappeared, for
the heavy tramp of men&rsquo;s feet was heard in the antechamber.
The interruption displeased the Dauphin,
and he was about to leave the room, but before he
could do so the new-comers stood at the door. It
only increased his displeasure that he was forced to
remain. The two men, whom he regarded with a
sinister expression, were rough and sturdy, men of
the class who stand fast in battle and look death
fearlessly in the eye, knights in the truest sense
of the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So quickly back, my brave La Hire?&rdquo; said
Charles to one of them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Our Lady, Your Majesty, never was there
greater need for quick and decisive action than now,&rdquo;
was his reply. &ldquo;I have just heard that Count Salisbury
has completely invested the city of Orleans.
Not even a cat can get out of it, and in a few weeks
it will be in the clutches of famine. If we do not
help them you can easily see&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help them!&rdquo; interrupted the Dauphin, despondently.
&ldquo;My good knight, how much money
do you suppose there is in my treasury? Ha!
ha!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The people will see to it that the treasury of
their legitimate King is filled if in turn they have
the assurance that he will make a stand for the
right, for his honor, and for the fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_35">35</div>
<p>&ldquo;And until then I suppose I can keep on with
my fasting cure to which my mother accustomed
me. You will not believe it, my good La Hire,
but it is the sad truth that my cook has notified
me he has nothing to serve to-day but a pair of
fowls and a hind-quarter of mutton. And you
are to be invited as guests to such a banquet as
that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, sire, that is all right. To-day we will
eat the fowls and the mutton; to-morrow we will
drive the English out of their kitchens, and seat
ourselves at their tables.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how are we going to drive them out?
It is impossible. Can I summon troops out of the
ground?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, sire, you can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dauphin looked at him with astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you take me for a wizard? Or, do you
mean I am in partnership with the devil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Resolution and courage, sire, have often worked
wonders. Inscribe them on your banner to-day,
and to-morrow it will not flutter deserted. It will
rally those around it who have fallen away discouraged
as well as those who follow the profession of
arms, and would gladly enlist under such a royal
banner for the sake of the rich reward. There are
men yet who are ready to stand by you with their
good swords. See, here is my stanch friend Saintrailles,&rdquo;
pointing to his companion, &ldquo;and he is not
the only one who is ready.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_36">36</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are welcome, brave knight,&rdquo; said Charles.
&ldquo;It is a shame I can only invite you to sit down to
two fowls and a leg of mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; replied Saintrailles, who could hardly restrain
his indignation, &ldquo;I was not thinking of your
table when I followed my friend here. I was thinking
of your wretched plight and of the bleeding
fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you believe it can be helped?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, sire, but he who would win must
venture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, and in the meantime he may also lose.
But, by my faith, I have not much more to
lose.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all the more to win. The brave soul thinks
only of winning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you talk like La Hire, and La Hire
talks like Marie, and Marie talks like&mdash;but if the
English would let me have Languedoc as an independent
dukedom, then&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He did not finish the sentence, for through the
side-door, which was partly open, he saw the warning
finger of Agnes Sorel. Then he resumed:</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad you have come, noble knights. We
will meet at table and further consider this matter.
But, alas! two fowls and a leg of mutton!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_37">37</div>
<p>On the evening of the same day, when La Hire
reached his lodgings and was laying off his armor, a
young man of about eighteen years entered. His
strong, supple frame, handsome, noble face, piercing
black eyes, lofty forehead beneath raven-black
hair, as well as his resolute, self-confident bearing,
impressed themselves upon the knight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you, and what do you wish?&rdquo; he
said, at the same time regarding the young man
with evident satisfaction.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name, noble knight, is probably unknown
to you,&rdquo; was his reply. &ldquo;My father of blessed
memory, however, left it to me unstained. I have
come to honor that name under your banner in the
service of the distressed King and the unhappy
fatherland.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well said, young man, and, by Our Lady, you
look to me like one who can use his sword as well
as his tongue. We will consider the matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you not accept my service, noble sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gently, young man. Do you suppose that I
confide the honor of my banner to every nameless
fellow? Out with your name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am called Jean Renault.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Renault? Was your father that Thomas
Renault who fell in the service of the Duke of
Orleans, fighting against the English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, noble sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_38">38</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then a thousand times welcome. Your father
was a brave knight and a noble gentleman. From
to-day you shall serve under my banner, and you
will have ample opportunities to earn your knightly
spurs.&rdquo; Thereupon he shook the young man&rsquo;s
hand heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you for your confidence, noble sir,&rdquo;
replied the new adherent, with beaming eyes. &ldquo;I
will do my utmost to justify this confidence, but
what I can do to earn my knightly spurs I do not
yet know, partly because of my youth, and also,
though it is no disgrace, partly because of my
poverty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poverty! Your father had property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; but it was at Rouen, and it has fallen into
the hands of the English.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, we will see that it is returned to you.
But now tell me where you acquired your training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under my father, to whose retinue I was last
attached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you have also fought against the English?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, I was in the battle in which my father fell
and the Duke of Orleans was captured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you are doubly welcome, my young friend,&rdquo;
warmly exclaimed the knight. &ldquo;I well know I cannot
take your father&rsquo;s place, but I will do for you
all that a man can.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_39">39</div>
<p>Overcome by such generosity, Jean pressed the
knight&rsquo;s proffered hand to his lips. His heart was
too full for words. La Hire understood his silence,
and admired him all the more. &ldquo;You are from the
neighborhood of Rouen, and are acquainted there?&rdquo;
he resumed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know every village thereabouts, noble sir.
Alas! they are nearly all ruined.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! God and the saints pity them. But, further,
do you know the Bishop of Beauvais?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly I know him. It is his diocese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is fortunate. I have a message for the
bishop, but no messenger who is acquainted with
that region, or cunning enough to evade the English.
I can trust you for both?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ready, noble sir, provided you do not wish
me to act as a spy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose, my young friend, that I would
choose you if I needed a spy? No, the mission
you are to undertake has nothing to do with the
war. However, I cannot conceal from you the
danger involved in the undertaking. The Bishop
of Beauvais has the reputation of loving money
and leaning to both sides. Do you understand
me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, noble sir. He is devoted, now to
the Burgundians, now to the Lotharingians, now to
the English, and now to the Duke of Orleans.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_40">40</div>
<p>&ldquo;Listen. The English might easily regard a messenger
to him as a spy, which, by Our Lady, would
grieve me. But then again, even if they should hold
you as a prisoner it would be uncomfortable, for
money is so scarce in our treasury that you might
have to wait a long time for your release.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not think, noble sir, that the English will
catch me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you will undertake the mission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I await your commands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rest to-day and to-morrow. The day after to-morrow
you shall have the letter for the Bishop.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As the road to Rouen led directly through the
English district it was practically impossible for
a messenger to make the journey on horseback.
Jean therefore decided to go on foot, disguised as a
peasant. As the cities around Orleans were in possession
of the English, he was continually forced to
take divergent routes. He made a wide circuit
around Paris, and at last approached Rouen from the
east. While on this part of his journey he stopped
in a forest one noon to rest and enjoy his simple
meal. While thus engaged, he suddenly heard a
female voice crying for help. He sprang up, and
ran to the road whence the cry had come. Concealing
himself behind some bushes, he watched and
listened. He heard the distant rattle of a carriage
and the clatter of armor toward the east. A heavy
travelling carriage soon came lumbering along the
rough road, accompanied by half a dozen men at
arms.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>&ldquo;Has a shameful crime been committed, and did
the cry come from that carriage?&rdquo; said Jean to himself.
&ldquo;What! I think I know the arms on the carriage
door. Why, certainly. They are the Duke of
Luxemburg&rsquo;s. But I must be sure of it.&rdquo; With
this he rushed from his hiding-place. &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; he
shouted, brandishing his knobbed stick.</p>
<p>The coachman and attendants were astonished.
It seemed incredible that a single man, armed with
such a weapon, should dare to order them to halt.
While they prepared for resistance they watched, not
so much the young man as the thickets, for they
were suspicious that other peasants might make their
appearance. During this brief waiting Jean discovered
what he had feared, and what he was so
anxious to ascertain. Scarcely had his &ldquo;halt&rdquo; died
away when a girl&rsquo;s face appeared at the carriage
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; she cried, in terror. &ldquo;Help!
They are dragging me to a convent&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>A smothered exclamation of pain followed the last
word. Some one inside the carriage had pulled her
back and stifled her cries. Instead of the girl&rsquo;s face
there now appeared at the door the wrathful face of
a knight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_42">42</div>
<p>&ldquo;Seize the dog,&rdquo; he shouted. &ldquo;Do not kill him.
I must have him alive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The men at arms prepared for action at once, but
Jean did not stir. He stood immovable as a statue,
staring at the door. The distress which he was
powerless to relieve threatened his own undoing,
but he remained as if glued to the spot, trying to
identify the personality of the victim. He had
only caught a fleeting glance of her, but that glance
left an impression that could not be effaced. She
was a girl of fifteen or sixteen years, and so radiantly
beautiful that even her expression of poignant suffering
and fear could not diminish her charm.</p>
<p>Meanwhile the men at arms were arranging their
plan. They evidently intended to surround and
overpower him, but their movements were too slow
to suit the knight in the carriage. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he
roared, &ldquo;what are you waiting for? Seize him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The command brought Jean to his senses, and
the first glance revealed his danger. With a quick
rush he broke through the circle of his assailants and
ran back into the thicket.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow him, ride him down,&rdquo; furiously cried the
knight.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>The men at arms rode after him, but before they
could overtake him he had disappeared in the woods,
where they could not follow him on horseback. To
dismount and pursue him on foot would have been
a rash undertaking, so they turned about only to
receive violent reproaches and curses from their
master, who was forced to resume his journey without
his wished-for victim.</p>
<p>Jean did not go far, for he well knew they would
not dare to follow him into the forest. Leaning
against a tree, he watched the carriage, which took
the road to Rouen. His first impulse was to follow
it and keep it in sight, but, upon second thought,
he remembered he was not at that moment his own
master, but was in the service of another, and that
under such circumstances he had no right to risk
his liberty or his life. Accordingly he let the carriage
go on several hours before he resumed his
journey.</p>
<p>Making allowance for the precautions he must
take, it would be three or four days before he could
reach Rouen. On the way he made several inquiries
as to the whereabouts of the carriage, so that
when he entered that city on the evening of the
fourth day, he knew it was there. At the inn where
he put up he passed himself off as a fugitive peasant
who desired an interview with the bishop, that he
might tell him of the sufferings of himself and his
fellow villagers. As his story was a probable one,
he hoped there would be no opposition to his remaining
there. He was told that the bishop arrived
two days before in the company of the Duke of
Luxemburg, and had brought a young novice to the
convent of Saint Ursula. He had gone away again
with the Duke, but only for a short time.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_44">44</div>
<p>Whenever Jean ventured out of the inn, he took
his way to the convent. He could see only its
outer walls, and yet he was drawn to it over and
over again. Near the convent stands the church of
Saint Ursula. As its doors were always open there
was nothing to prevent him from entering and praying
fervently for the unhappy girl he had seen in
the forest. One day he as usual selected a spot
close to the wall between the church and the convent
for his devotions. This wall must have been
in frequent use, for there was a door in it opening
upon a passage-way to the other buildings. While
Jean was praying the church was empty, and in the
gathering shades of evening the sacred room was
quiet and restful. In the profound silence it seemed
to him that he heard human sobs in the distance.
He listened intently. There could be no doubt of
it. He was not deceived. The sound seemed to
come out of the wall. He placed his ear against the
stone, and distinctly heard a woman&rsquo;s painful ejaculations
between alternate groans and gentle sobs.
A cold sweat stood on his brow. He felt rooted to
the spot. The longer he listened the fiercer grew
the storm in his breast. At last he could endure
it no longer. He rushed out into the air. His
heart was almost bursting. &ldquo;The captive lady!&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;can it be she?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_45">45</div>
<p>His despair drew him again to the spot, and again
he listened. His pulse beat so feverishly, and he
was under such excitement, that it was impossible
for him to judge calmly, but he fancied he recognized
the voice.</p>
<p>During the remainder of his stay in Rouen Jean
spent his time almost exclusively in trying to discover
the fate of this unfortunate one, but it was in
vain. He only found that he was drawing attention
to himself, and this attention at last became so apparent
that after delivering the letter to the Bishop
he was forced to leave Rouen abruptly and make
his way back.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="h2line1">Chapter III</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Conspiracy</span></h2>
<p>Four leagues distant from Cambray<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a> the
towers of Beaurevoir Castle rise from forest-crowned
heights. In selecting this spot
the builders combined the useful and the
beautiful, for the castle was famous both for its
strength and for its attractive situation. The view
from the upper windows and from the towers repaid
the appreciative observer at any season of the year,
but he would have lingered longest in admiration
when park and gardens, wood and meadow, field
and grove were decked in the beauty of early spring,
when the thickly clustered villages, east, west, and
north, smiled amid their luxuriant crops, or when
on the southern heights the Argonne forest was
clad in its most gorgeous greenery. How much
more attractive the beauties of this spot must have
been to a child whose greatest delight was to
be among the flowers of the garden and meadow,
the birds in the parks, and the varied scenery!
How closely such a child must have been attached
to such a spot! How strong its temptation to
pass all its time with nature!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_47">47</div>
<p>Just such a child as this had been allured to the
park and gardens by the sunshine of an early April
day in the year last named,&mdash;a girl blooming with
color, vigorous with health. At a distance she appeared
to be about eighteen years of age, but closer
observation showed she could not have been much
over fifteen. Of all the beautiful things in this
beautiful scene she was the most attractive, as she
frolicked and skipped about like a fawn, bounding
over the flowery meadows for the first time. As
she ran about in the sunshine she gave expression
to her childish joy at each fresh manifestation of the
marvellous work of spring, and broke out in most
exultant exclamations when she discovered the first
violets in the grass.</p>
<p>Two ladies slowly following her, and engaged in
earnest conversation, were attracted by her outcries.
&ldquo;There now,&rdquo; said one of them, a somewhat slender
person with angular features and sharp eyes, &ldquo;you
see what an undisciplined creature she is. Is it
proper for her to behave in such a manner? This
comes of letting her have her own way. How often
have I protested! But of what use is it? When
you see that your talking is of no avail it is best
to hold your tongue. If you do not, then they say,
&lsquo;Oh, yes, that&rsquo;s the way envious old spinsters always
talk.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>The other lady, whose handsome face, beaming
with good nature, was in striking contrast with that
of her companion, cast an appealing glance at her.
&ldquo;Oh, dear Rosette, are you not mistaken? Who
would dare to insult my husband&rsquo;s sister by making
such a remark?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, well, you know people often think many
things they do not say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is true. But even if they do, why should
you conclude they are thinking things about you
they do not venture to say?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot give you any precise reason.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I must tell you it is not kind to think
evil of others, especially of your own friends, unless
you have sufficient cause to do so. But never
mind. You were speaking of Marie. You are
offended with the behavior of the poor child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child! A fine child she is,&mdash;ha! ha! You
ought to have known some time ago that she is no
longer a child. She is a grown-up girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us hope she may not discover it for a long
time yet. How happy she would be if she could
always preserve her childlike nature! Look at her,
dear Rosette! Is it not a beautiful sight&mdash;such
an innocent child, sporting in pure delight?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>The sister-in-law turned up her nose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why is not her behavior proper?&rdquo; continued
the other. &ldquo;Proper! What is proper?
Are not many things proper which are called highly
improper? Marie is in her own world here. She
has grown up in it, is attached to it, and enjoys herself
in it. You cannot imagine how delighted I am
to see her thus. Poor little one! Orphaned at an
early age, she has never known the comfort of a
father&rsquo;s or mother&rsquo;s embraces, and shall I begrudge
her her harmless pleasures?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It would be much better if she were to begin
leading a more quiet and serious life right away, in
preparation for her future.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What has the future in store for her?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is she not intended for the convent?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who says so? She is sole heir of Louis of
Chafleur, who has left her a rich property. Why
should she take the veil?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She will not take it voluntarily. I think it is
the wish of your husband.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you are mistaken. At least, I do not
know of any such plan. John simply said that a
convent would be the safest retreat for Marie in
case the tumult of war should invade the Argonne
forest. To seek the shelter of a convent and to
take the veil are two different things.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_50">50</div>
<p>Rosette&rsquo;s eyes glistened with malicious triumph
as she looked at Marie, who at that instant came
bounding forward with a bunch of violets and put
an end to the conversation; her look seemed to say,
&ldquo;I know some things better than you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While this was going on in the park, two men
were standing at an upper window of the castle.
They were considerably beyond middle age, and
resembled one another in a certain cold, crafty, calculating
expression of countenance. One of them
wore the usual costume of a knight, the other the
conventional dress of a high church dignitary. One
was John of Luxemburg, lord of the castle; the
other, Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The girl is really a handsome child,&rdquo; said the
Bishop, as he looked at Marie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; slowly assented the lord of the castle.
&ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added with a peculiar twinkle of the
eye, &ldquo;I know something that is more beautiful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prelate understood. &ldquo;Hm! I won&rsquo;t dispute
that. These are fine possessions. It would
be a pity to have them pass into the hands of
strangers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have echoed my very thought, your reverence.
So I think we are agreed on the general
point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mean that in these times of disturbance
there is no place where Marie will be so secure as
in the cell of a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>&ldquo;Exactly, and unless I am mistaken that is also
what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a general sense, yes; but we have not yet
considered the most important point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us come to it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The question arises, How is the girl to be secured
for the convent? and next, How is she to be
taken there?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see that she is taken there. As to the
rest of the business, I appeal to the experience of
your reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! a difficult task when, as in this case, the
novice has the utmost aversion to a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not so difficult as appears at first sight. I
know of similar cases where the task has been successfully
accomplished.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but under peculiar circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The circumstances in our case are similar.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s face wore a crafty expression.
&ldquo;That is truly quite another thing. Let us hear
about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course Marie&rsquo;s property remains in possession
of her guardian until she reaches legal age,
when it is at her disposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is clear. But what will the Church get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Patience, your reverence. If she should not
reach that age&mdash;and that is not impossible&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_52">52</div>
<p>&ldquo;I understand that in such a case the property is
legally mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is also clear. But what will the Church get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;In that case we can make an agreement as to
how much the Church shall have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We understand each other, noble knight. But
supposing she reaches legal age?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then the Church must see to it that the legal
requirements are not binding. I say &lsquo;legal requirements.&rsquo;
You understand me, holy father?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perfectly, my noble friend. Sometimes we have
had to grant exemptions from requirements which
afterwards were shown to have been void because of
irregularities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad we understand each other so well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what will the Church get?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same as in the other case, namely, a share
of the property, only the Church will not come
into actual possession until after the death of the
testatrix.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hm! It seems to me, my noble friend, that
you not only propose to take the lion&rsquo;s share, but
the entire prize. The Church would have the first
claim in case of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t let me finish, your reverence.
Until the death of the heir I will secure you, as the
representative of the Church, a yearly income of
three hundred pounds.&rdquo;</p>

<p class="caption"><i>&ldquo;Dear uncle, see these beautiful violets,&rdquo; she cried</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_53">53</div>
<p>The Bishop&rsquo;s eyes glistened. &ldquo;And the security?&rdquo;
he said, stretching out his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My word, the word of a nobleman;&rdquo; and they
shook hands.</p>
<p>A pause ensued. Each of the men, in the stillness,
seemed to be studying whether he might not
find eventually that he had been overreached and
had not received his proper share. The Bishop was
the first to come to a decision, and asked, &ldquo;When
shall we begin our work, noble friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At once, if you are ready.&rdquo; Thereupon he rang
a bell, and ordered the servant who answered it to
call Mademoiselle de Chafleur.</p>
<p>It was not long before Marie came running into
the room, full of joyous exultation. &ldquo;Dear uncle,
see these beautiful violets,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh, what
delicious perfume!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very beautiful indeed. They are messengers
sent by Spring to the other flowers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be so. Oh, you cannot imagine how
beautiful the park is already! Tell me quickly what
I am to do, so that I can return soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you find it very pleasant in the park?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I could stay there always.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am all the more sorry, then, that you will have
to leave it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! Leave! Uncle, I do not understand
you.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, child. The tumult of war approaches
nearer and nearer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What of that? Is not the castle safe? Let the
Englishmen come. We will send those long-nosed
gentlemen home again. Yes, &lsquo;we,&rsquo; I say, for you
know I am a Chafleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the highest respect for your courage, my
little Amazon, but the English will not be greatly
scared by it. No, child, I must find a safer place
for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And my aunts?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, that is a different matter. My wife and sister
must submit to the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I can also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, child. Your father sacredly intrusted you
to me. I should not be keeping my word if I exposed
you to the dangers of war.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I say again, uncle, and you have said
yourself, that the castle is safe enough.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still it can be taken; but no enemy will dare to
attack the sacred walls of a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A convent! What do you mean? Do you intend
to make me a nun? Me! A nun! Ha!
ha! ha! I shall die a-laughing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not always nuns who find shelter in a
convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless, uncle, and once for all, I say I
will have nothing to do with a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_55">55</div>
<p>&ldquo;Then tell me what you will do, for you cannot
stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you in earnest, uncle?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Absolutely so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tears came to the girl&rsquo;s eyes. Sobbing, and
throwing her arms around his neck, she exclaimed:
&ldquo;Uncle, you cannot send me away from you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is for your safety, my child.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I do not wish any special safety. Where
my aunts can stay, I can stay.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is of no use. No use. My decision is final.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl stood erect. She wiped the tears from
her eyes and looked at the knight with a strange
and distressed expression. Gradually her look became
colder and more fixed, and at last he realized
her undaunted determination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My decision is made too, uncle. I will not go
to a convent. I would rather fall into the hands of
the English. But the situation is not so desperate
as that. I will let my kinsman La Hire know. He
will protect me. Let me have a messenger, uncle.
In an hour I will have a letter ready.&rdquo; Thereupon
she left the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think now, noble knight?&rdquo;
began the Bishop.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah!&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;I will send her a messenger
who will throw her letter into the first forest brook
he comes to, and return without seeing La Hire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>On the morning of the fourteenth day after this
scene, a heavy travelling carriage stood in the castle
yard with an escort of six armed men. Marie lay
sobbing in the arms of Madame de Luxemburg.
Still sobbing, she at last followed the impatient lord
of the castle to the carriage. Nothing had been heard
from La Hire, and when, as John of Luxemburg
had said, an attack upon the castle was likely to be
made, he told Marie he would accompany her to her
kinsman. At the first inn they met the Bishop of
Beauvais, apparently by accident. As he was journeying
in the same direction he accepted the knight&rsquo;s
invitation to take a seat in the carriage.</p>
<p>Overcome with grief, and not expecting any
trickery, Marie at first did not notice the road they
were taking. After passing three or four inns, however,
she saw that they were going west instead of
south. Not even then did she suspect treachery.
They easily satisfied her inquiries by pretending they
must take a circuitous route to avoid encountering
the English. When, however, they kept on in the
same direction the next day, her suspicions were
fully aroused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you cannot deceive me any
longer; you are not taking me to Chinon. What
are you going to do with me?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_57">57</div>
<p>&ldquo;I will not deceive you, child,&rdquo; replied the knight,
for pretense was useless any longer. &ldquo;I cannot carry
out my plan to take you to Chinon. The whole
district of the Loire is in the hands of the English.
I cannot even get back to Beaurevoir, so nothing
remains but&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what?&rdquo; she piteously exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She uttered a scream of terror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; said the knight, harshly. &ldquo;If you
scream again I will silence you in a way that may
not be agreeable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They were in a forest where fugitive peasants
might be in hiding. Even at a distance from it, he
had been fearful lest the girl might attract some one&rsquo;s
attention. He wished to reach his destination without
being observed, and was particularly anxious no
one should even suspect where he was or what he
was doing.</p>
<p>Marie was not frightened by his threat, but a quick
glance showed her they were in a forest where no
help of any kind could be expected. In despair she
sank back into a corner of the carriage. Anger,
desperation, and scorn raged by turns in her breast,
until at last, overcome by exhaustion, she buried her
face in her hands and wept.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_58">58</div>
<p>The vigorous &ldquo;halt&rdquo; of a manly voice aroused
her from her wretched condition. In an instant
she was at the carriage door. Her first glance fell
upon a handsome youth who was advancing courageously
toward the carriage. The reader knows who
he was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help! help!&rdquo; she involuntarily cried. &ldquo;They
are taking me to a convent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Her guardian pulled her back, and silenced her
cries by holding his handkerchief over her mouth.
She tried desperately to release herself,&mdash;but what
availed her weakness against the strength of a trained
knight? In her anguish the image of the brave
youth rose before her, and her anxiety about his
fate made her forget her own. She listened intently
to all that was going on outside. She trembled
when it seemed impossible for her to escape, but at
last she exulted when she knew that he was safe.</p>
<p>It was late at night when the carriage came to a
stop. Marie knew by the call of a watchman that
they were either before a city or a castle. The
Bishop gave his name, and the creaking gate opened.
The carriage passed through several dark streets, and
stopped at last before a large, gloomy building.
Here also the Bishop&rsquo;s name was an Open Sesame;
the heavy bolts were pushed back, the carriage rolled
over a paved yard, and with a hollow, fateful sound
the gate was closed and locked.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_59">59</div>
<p>Marie shook as in an ague fit. She realized that
she was a prisoner, and perhaps was cut off from all
the pleasures of life; but not a sound escaped her
lips. Her mute sorrow alone reproached her persecutors.
She did not know she was in the Ursuline
Convent at Rouen, but she had no doubt it was some
convent in the Bishop&rsquo;s diocese. Evidently they
were ready to receive an exalted guest, whom they
had expected, in a manner befitting her station. The
abbess, a lady of middle age, who, judging by her
speech and manners, might have been of high rank,
was awaiting her in the parlor. After the Bishop
had exchanged a few words with her, the abbess
turned to Marie and said: &ldquo;May your entrance
among us be blest, Mademoiselle de Chafleur. I
hope these sacred walls will furnish you both the
outward security which you need, and your heart
that peace which the world cannot give.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was something so cordial, and withal so
winning, in the tone with which she spoke these
words, that Marie pressed her extended hand to
her lips with the utmost sincerity, and covered it
with kisses. She longed to throw herself into
the arms of this gracious lady, and weep away her
sorrow as she would on a mother&rsquo;s breast. Her
longing was so overpowering that she sank upon
her knees and moistened the abbess&rsquo;s hand with her
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Save me, gracious lady, save me,&rdquo; she implored.
&ldquo;I am the victim of a conspiracy. They
have deceived me, brought me here by force, and
torn me from all that is dear and sacred to me.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_60">60</div>
<p>The astonished abbess cast an inquiring glance at
the Bishop. &ldquo;The novice,&rdquo; he said in reply to it,
&ldquo;is here because it is the wish of her guardian, a
lord of Luxemburg, who alone has authority to act
for her. Therefore it is idle to talk of force. To
your&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not a novice,&rdquo; cried Marie, rising. &ldquo;I
am Marie of Chafleur. My guardian has control
of my property, but he has no right arbitrarily to
dispose of my person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I trust your ability,&rdquo; resumed the Bishop, &ldquo;to
remove these worldly ideas, which are unbecoming
within these sacred walls, and to implant in this
perverse soul the spirit of quiet resignation and
Christian humility. I authorize you to employ
all the means which are at your command to
produce this result, and I have no doubt of their
efficacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The last words were spoken with a peculiar intonation
which was in the nature of a command to
the abbess, but of the significance of which the poor
child had not the most remote idea. The abbess,
who understood well enough what was expected from
her, made a quiet sign of assent, and the two men
took their leave, firmly convinced that their work
was completed successfully.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_61">61</div>
<p>Marie was assigned to the usual cell and left
alone. She first went to the grated window. It
looked out only upon the yard. With a pitiful sob
she threw herself upon the hard couch. Her tears
flowed, and she gave vent to her anguish in melancholy
ejaculations. At last she knelt before the
crucifix and poured out her aching heart in long
and fervent prayer. Again she quietly sought her
couch. She was now able to think calmly over recent
events. As she was ignorant of what was in
store for her, she was still buoyant with the hopefulness
of youth. She thought of La Hire, whom
she had known as an honorable knight. The
image of the young man also mingled pleasantly in
her thoughts of the future. She decided she would
write again to La Hire. He could not have deserted
her. Thus consoling herself, she sank into
kindly slumber. Poor child! Little she knew
that her letters could not find their way into
the outside world without first being read by the
superior.</p>
<p>One day two nuns, commissioned to acquaint her
with the rules of the Ursuline order, visited her.
Her declaration that she did not wish to know
them made no impression upon the sisters. They
performed their duty, and then withdrew to make
their report. Shortly afterwards another sister entered,
and summoned the novice to prepare herself
by prayer and fasting for the vow which she was
shortly to take.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_62">62</div>
<p>&ldquo;What means this farce?&rdquo; said Marie. &ldquo;I am
not a novice. I will not join your order. I will
not take a vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Our wishes are useless within these walls,&rdquo; replied
the sister. &ldquo;We must do what the superior,
the abbess, and the rules of the order command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that to me? I am not one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will do well, sister, to submit to the inevitable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what if I do not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then they will force you to submit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Force me, Marie of Chafleur! I should like
to hear how they propose to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can tell you, sister. They will lock you in
your cell and let you go half starved.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, I would rather wholly starve than take
the vow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will thrust you into a gloomy prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They will come daily to your prison and punish
you without mercy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie shrieked aloud. She clenched her fists.
Her lips quivered. &ldquo;Woman,&rdquo; she at last exclaimed,
&ldquo;the devil has sent you to tempt me! Leave me.
Go and report that I will suffer death rather than
consent.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_63">63</div>
<p>&ldquo;I must first do what I have been ordered, sister.&rdquo;
Thereupon the nun knelt before the crucifix
and repeated aloud the prayers which were prescribed
as a preparation for the vow. When she
had finished she withdrew. What she had said
came to pass. Marie first was locked in her cell
and given only a scanty bit of bread. When that
proved of no avail she was put into the prison. It
was her loud laments which Jean had heard while
praying in the church of Saint Ursula, for the
prison was only separated from the church by a
single wall.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_64">64</div>
<h2 id="c4"><span class="h2line1">Chapter IV</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">In Camp and Court</span></h2>
<p>News of the siege of the City of Orleans
by the English at last reached the village
of Domremy. No one was more deeply
affected by it than Joan, for she believed
from what her confessor had told the villagers that
with the fall of Orleans the King&rsquo;s cause would be
lost, that there was no hope for the raising of the
siege, and that the wretchedness of the fatherland
would then be complete.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_65">65</div>
<p>Scarcely had Joan heard the news before she
left the village to meditate upon this new situation
in some one of her favorite solitudes. She was at
this time about seventeen years of age, blooming
and beautiful in person, but unchanged in nature
and habits. She longed to abandon herself to her
thoughts and impressions in solitude as she used to
do when tending her father&rsquo;s flocks. Deep down in
her heart she felt the sorrows of others now as she
did then, and was moved by the same irresistible
desire to help them. She longed to prostrate herself
before her saints, to look into the clouds with
supernatural vision and see their figures and hear
their voices as she used to do. Her communion
with the spiritual world at this time had become so
intimate that she could question her saints and hear
their instant replies. The Fairy Tree, under which
she fed the birds, the miraculous spring where the
fawns frisked about her, and the chapel at the
cross-road near the oak forest, in which she had
most of her visions, were her favorite resorts. In
this chapel she knelt before the image of Saint Catherine,
unconscious of the outside world. The burden
of her fervent prayer was the necessities of the
country, the rescue of the City of Orleans, and
the coronation of the King.</p>
<p>&ldquo;O that I were a man! O that I were a commander!&rdquo;
she sighed. &ldquo;I would rush to the rescue.
Perhaps it is not impossible. Does not the
wolf fly from me when my saints are near? Can
I not hide my maiden&rsquo;s figure in the garb of the
soldier? Are not these limbs strong enough to wear
armor? What if the dear saints should commission
me to rescue the fatherland!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Absorbed in such thoughts and longings, she lost
herself in communion with the celestial world, and
in a vision she saw her favorite saints in the glowing
clouds.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_66">66</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you tarry, Joan?&rdquo; said the voices.
&ldquo;Cities and villages are being destroyed every day.
Daily the blood of the people is being shed.
Arise! Execute the decree of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But,&rdquo; said Joan, &ldquo;how may I know it is
Heaven which sends me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The signs of your mission will not fail.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what is my mission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To raise the siege of the city of Orleans, and
conduct the King to his coronation at Rheims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How shall I begin?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the King and offer yourself to him as
commander of the army.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To whom shall I apply so that I may reach the
King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to the knight, Robert of Baudricourt.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a>
He will help you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Joan returned home, and remained several days
deeply absorbed in contemplating the mission to
which she had been assigned. She would often
steal away to her little chamber and weep bitterly;
for although she felt exalted by the heavenly decree,
still, it seemed impossible for her secretly to leave all
the dear ones at home,&mdash;father, mother, brothers,
and sister. And yet she must go secretly, for her
father never would approve of her purpose or consent
to her going, and no other way suggested itself.
They had grown so accustomed to seeing her absorbed
in silent and solitary meditations that they
kept aloof from her at such times. It had been
village gossip for years that she communicated with
spirits and practised magic. In what other way
indeed could her mastery of the wild beasts be explained?
Her brother Pierre, however, who was devotedly
attached to her, was an exception. He never
pained her by suspicions. She had no secrets from
him, and she came to him now in perfect confidence
and wept upon his breast.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_67">67</div>
<p>&ldquo;It is not true, Pierre,&rdquo; she said, looking up at
him with her beautiful tearful eyes, &ldquo;that you
mock at me as the others do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can you think such a thing of me, little
sister?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I do not think it, my brother.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet your question seems to imply that you
do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not at all, Pierre. I know very well that you
love me, but you must tell me so over and over
again. I know very well you do not mock me,
but even that does not satisfy me. I must have
the assurance from your own lips.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know very well, Joan, that you are a favorite
with your saints, that they manifest themselves to
you in the clouds, and that you talk with them as
you talk with us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes; you believe me when I tell you these
things. But when I tell the others&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_68">68</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my sister, they do not know you as I do.
I know that you never speak an untruth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet my actions now must be deceitful.
Alas! Pierre, that is what distresses me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But remember, little sister, that you are obeying
the celestial ones, that it is the fatherland which
calls you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And still it grieves me, my brother. I go
about here just as usual. Father, mother, and all
the others think that I shall always go on this way,
and I let them think so, and purposely strengthen
this belief while I am preparing to leave them
secretly. Oh, Pierre, they will never forgive me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you distress yourself with such
thoughts, my sister? You know that you must undertake
this mission. And it is right you should,
for the will of Heaven is superior to the human will.
When father and mother and the others hear what
Heaven has accomplished through you, do you not
think they will forgive you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your words have done me good, my brother,&rdquo;
cried Joan, her clear, brilliant eyes shining with
happiness. &ldquo;Would that I could always have you
by my side and hear your voice! If you were
near I would fear no one whom I may encounter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will go with you, my sister.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Pierre, you cannot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why not?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_69">69</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is it not enough for me to bring sorrow to
our parents? Would you add to that sorrow by
secretly going away also?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right. I ought not to go. You are
obeying the decree of Heaven, but I cannot offer
that plea. But I know of some one who might go
with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Uncle Laxart. He also loves you, and he will
not have to ask permission of any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But will he go?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak to him about it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day (in the year 1429)&mdash;it was the day
of the Three Holy Kings&mdash;Joan crossed the snow-covered
valley to the Fairy Tree, sprinkled crumbs
for the birds as usual, and listened to their grateful
songs. Soon afterwards she was lost in deep reverie
in the chapel at the cross-roads, and while in this
state her enraptured eyes beheld her saints, Catherine
and Margaret, in the clouds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The hour has come, Joan,&rdquo; she heard them say.
&ldquo;Arise! the Queen of Heaven will be with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go all alone,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;They
will call me an adventuress.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so! Your protector is already at the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As Joan arose she saw a man approaching the
chapel. With joyous surprise she recognized her
uncle, Duram Laxart.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_70">70</div>
<p>&ldquo;I know all, Joan,&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;I am ready
to escort you as soon as you need my protection.
I have already been to Vaucouleurs and have seen
the knight Baudricourt. Start as soon as you can
get ready. We will lodge with Wagner, whom you
know.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before the astonished maiden could reply her
uncle was off in the direction of Vaucouleurs.</p>
<p>The time for departure had come at last. Deeply
agitated, she stood at the door of the chapel, and
looked once more with tearful eyes out over the
valley. Once more her gaze lingered upon the
miraculous spring, the Fairy Tree, and her home
at Domremy, and her soul was filled with tender
and sacred associations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, O Wonder Tree, where I have spent
so many happy hours,&rdquo; she said between her sobs.
&ldquo;And you, little birds, farewell! Alas! Joan can
never feed you again. In vain will you wait for her.
Farewell, dear spring, whose music I have heard so
often in my happy dreams. Tell the deer I cannot
play with them again. Farewell, loved valleys and
fields! How happy I was when I played here with
the companions of my childhood! Alas! I shall
never see you again! Farewell, my father! My
beloved mother, farewell! And you, my Pierre,
my good, dear brother. Oh, how hard it is to leave
you! Alas! never again shall I look into your
true eyes, never again hear words of love and
sympathy from your lips. Farewell all, all farewell!
Grieve not that I leave you. Be not angry.
It cannot be otherwise. No! it must be so, for
Heaven has decreed it, and the fatherland has called
me. Away, Joan, away! The struggle is at hand.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_71">71</div>
<p>No one could have seen the simple peasant
maiden at that moment, her eyes shining as the tears
glistened on their lashes, no one could have realized
her strength of will in giving up all that had filled
her soul with sorrow as she thought of leaving
it, no one could have watched her passing down
the valley like a soldier defiant of danger, without
the conviction that it was an event fraught with the
highest significance for France.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_72">72</div>
<p>Joan found her uncle at Wagner&rsquo;s house in Vaucouleurs.
He had already called upon Baudricourt,
but was sent away with instructions to reprove
his silly niece and take her back to her parents.
Though not in the least discouraged, Joan spent
the night in prayer, and in the morning went to
see Baudricourt. She found him in the company
of Jean de Nouillemport de Metz. Both laughed
when they learned the nature of her errand, but she
spoke with such sincere conviction of her celestial
visions that Baudricourt at last dismissed her with a
promise to give the matter serious consideration.
Subsequently, when Joan prayed in the church, and
the people came in crowds to see &ldquo;the saint,&rdquo; a
priest approached her with a crucifix to see if she
was possessed of the devil. Joan fell upon her
knees and kissed the holy symbol, and the priest
declared, &ldquo;She may be mad but she is not possessed.&rdquo;
On her way out of the church she met the knight
Nouillemport de Metz, to whom she thus appealed:
&ldquo;Alas! No one will believe me, and yet France
can be saved only by me.&rdquo; The words reminded
him of the prophecy of Merlin. After observing
her more closely, and recognizing her spiritual purity
and her resolute determination of purpose, he expressed
his willingness to take her to the Dauphin,
and he had little difficulty in persuading Baudricourt
to join him. A few days afterwards Joan
was delighted to find herself on the way to Chinon
with the knights and their men at arms. In her
costume she looked like a slim, handsome page
rather than a trooper. Chinon was more than one
hundred and fifty leagues away, and for half that
distance the country was occupied by the English.
Hence they were obliged to make wide circuits, and
frequently halt in the forests and ford rivers. After
a fourteen days&rsquo; march they reached the city of
Gien<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a>
on the Loire. The news spread like wildfire that
the Maiden who, according to Merlin&rsquo;s prophecy,
was to rescue France, had come, and all hastened to
extend her an enthusiastic welcome.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_73">73</div>
<p>After leaving Gien there was little danger, and at
last they safely reached Chinon and put up at an
inn. Here, as at Gien, the news of Joan&rsquo;s arrival
spread rapidly, and attracted a great crowd. To
satisfy the universal curiosity, she appeared on the
balcony and was welcomed with enthusiastic shouts.
Her knightly companions promptly waited upon
the Dauphin; but they found him greatly discouraged
and in a despondent mood because of the news
that the Englishman, John Falstaff, had repulsed
the French, who tried to prevent him from taking
supplies of herring to his countrymen before
Orleans. The Dauphin&rsquo;s disappointment over the
&ldquo;herrings day&rdquo; defeat, however, would have been
short-lived had he not at the same time been overtaken
by a calamity which seemed to him even
worse, namely, his utter lack of money and the
consequent emptiness of his kitchen and cellar. In
such a mood Joan&rsquo;s companions found him. At
first he listened to them with indifference and a
contemptuous smile, but when they told him the
people had recognized the Maiden as a saint, and
welcomed her as the rescuer of France, it occurred
to him she might be instrumental in relieving his
necessitous condition. At last he ordered that she
should be admitted. To test the prophetic gift
ascribed to her, he received her standing among the
nobles of his court, while another person sat on the
throne.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_74">74</div>
<p>Joan recognized him at once, however, and advancing
to him, knelt, and greeted him with these
words: &ldquo;God grant you a long and happy life,
Dauphin.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a></p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Yonder is
the King,&rdquo; pointing to the person on the throne.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble prince,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;you cannot
deceive me. You are the Dauphin.&rdquo; A murmur
of astonishment ran through the hall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; she continued, &ldquo;if we can be alone I will
tell you something that will remove all doubt as to
my mission.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a></p>
<p>The Dauphin conducted her to the adjacent oratory,
and there, according to the tradition, she
revealed things to him which he was certain none
could know but God and himself. He was so sure
of this that at the close of the interview he exclaimed:
&ldquo;I am convinced of your divine commission, but
my councillors must also be convinced.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_75">75</div>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, sire,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Summon the
three most learned and experienced to meet me
in the morning, and I will give them a sign.&rdquo;
Her wish was gratified. The three selected were
the Archbishop of Rheims, Charles of Bourbon,
and De la Tremouille, the King&rsquo;s minister. They
first required her to give her history, and then they
asked for the sign. Joan went back to the oratory.
Then, according to tradition, the heavenly ones
appeared, and with them an angel in long white raiment.
The latter carried a brilliant crown and
slowly advanced into the audience-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; said the angel, &ldquo;trust this maiden whom
Heaven sends to you. Give her at once as many
soldiers as you can raise. As a sign that you shall be
crowned at Rheims, Heaven sends you this token.&rdquo;
Thereupon the angel handed the crown to the Archbishop,
went out as he had entered, and disappeared
through the ceiling of the oratory. So says the
tradition.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_76">76</div>
<p>The three councillors were not yet fully satisfied,
however. They suggested that Joan should be
examined by the learned theologians of the University
of Poitiers.<a class="fn" id="fr_20" href="#fn_20">[20]</a>
When they also asked her for a
sign, she replied: &ldquo;Give me soldiers and you shall
have signs enough.&rdquo; They finally reported that
she was trustworthy, and that the King ought to
accept her service. The Dauphin&rsquo;s council promptly
decided to raise as many troops as possible, place
the Maiden in command of them, and send her with
a convoy of supplies to Orleans. In these few days
popular sentiment had changed rapidly, cheerful self-sacrifice
and enthusiastic eagerness for action took
the place of discouragement and dissension. Knights
and their men at arms offered their services, and
wealthy burghers sacrificed their treasures for the
cause of the country. The Dauphin at last was
also in a cheerful frame of mind, for his treasury
was filling up and he could once more take some
pleasure in living. He was also in a position now
to be of service to the Maiden. He presented her
with a general&rsquo;s outfit,&mdash;a master of horse, two
pages, two heralds, and a chaplain.</p>
<p>About this time the Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on<a class="fn" id="fr_21" href="#fn_21">[21]</a>
returned from English captivity. He noticed with great delight
that every one was eager to follow the Maiden
into battle. He immediately mortgaged his property,
purchased war equipment, and accepted the
duty of preparing the convoy of supplies. Joan
met with an affectionate welcome from his wife, who
had come to Blois, where the preparations were
going on.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_77">77</div>
<p>The twenty-sixth of April, 1429, was fixed as the
day of departure. Joan had previously sent her
herald Guienne with a letter to the Duke of
Bedford<a class="fn" id="fr_22" href="#fn_22">[22]</a>,
which she had dictated to her chaplain. It
ran thus:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;[Jesus, Maria]</p>
<p>&ldquo;King of England, account to the Queen of Heaven
for the blood you have shed. Surrender to the Maiden
the keys of all the good towns you have captured. She
offers you peace in the name of God if you make reparation
and honestly return what you have taken. If you fail
to do this she will everywhere attack your troops and drive
them out of the country. And you, archers and soldiers
before Orleans, go quietly back to your own country, or
protect yourselves against the Maiden. France has not
been given by Holy Mary&rsquo;s Son to you, but to the true
heir, King Charles, who will enter Paris in good company.
You shall see who has the better right, God or you, De
la Pole, Count of Suffolk, Talbot and Thomas, who have
taken the field for the Duke of Bedford, the so-called
regent of the Kingdom of France for the King of England.
If you do not leave the city of Orleans peacefully,
Duke of Bedford, you will force the French to achieve the
most glorious exploit ever known in Christendom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Written on Tuesday in Passion Week.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="pb" id="Page_78">78</div>
<p>This letter, however, never was answered. The
herald did not come back.</p>
<p>On the day appointed the expedition set out from
Blois. At its head was a procession of priests singing
hymns, Joan&rsquo;s chaplain leading them with his
banner. Next followed the leaders, Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on,
Marshal de Retz, Admiral de Coulent, De la Maison,
Laval, Potou de Saintrailles, Count Dunois and La
Hire, in whose retinue was Jean Renault. Then
came two hundred horsemen, and a long train of
wagons loaded with supplies brought up the rear.
Joan in full armor, wearing a shining helmet which
covered her closely cropped locks, and carrying a
sword whose hilt and scabbard were ornamented
with lilies, rode among the leaders. Upon one
side of her banner, which was thickly sprinkled with
lilies, was a picture of the Saviour with the orb in
His hand and an angel on either side of Him; on
the other, the inscription, &ldquo;Jesus, Maria.&rdquo;<a class="fn" id="fr_23" href="#fn_23">[23]</a>
Her demeanor was serious and dignified, serene confidence
shone in her beaming eyes. Her only regrets were
the profanity of the soldiers and La Hire&rsquo;s loud
prayer every morning and evening: &ldquo;Dear God!
do for La Hire as he would do for Thee if he were
the dear God and Thou wert La Hire.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_79">79</div>
<p>On the third day they were before Orleans, but
the city was on the other side of the Loire, and
there was no bridge. They occupied a redoubt on
their side of the river, which the English had abandoned
because it was of no use to them. At this
juncture the Bastard of Orleans,<a class="fn" id="fr_24" href="#fn_24">[24]</a>
commander of
the city, came in a barge to meet them. By his advice
they went two leagues farther up the river and
made a halt near Castle Ch&eacute;cy, where they found a
French garrison. Count Dunois agreed to send a
fleet for the transportation of the supplies, but at
three in the afternoon it had not come. The sky
was overcast, thunder growled in the distance, and
the waves of the Loire were lashed by fierce winds.
The courage of the soldiers began to waver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this storm subsides,&rdquo; said the Duc
d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, &ldquo;the English vessels will be here instead
of ours, and then all will be lost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you forget,&rdquo; said the Maiden, &ldquo;that I
promised you in the name of God we should enter
Orleans successfully.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! it does not look as if you could keep
your promise,&rdquo; replied the Duke.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_80">80</div>
<p>&ldquo;Have a little patience,&rdquo; said Joan, as she closely
scanned the sky. &ldquo;Before a quarter of an hour
passes the wind will change.&rdquo; She retired a little
distance to pray, but hardly had she knelt before a
favoring wind sprung up and the vessels which had
been detained by the storm arrived.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now what do you think of that, Jean?&rdquo; said La
Hire, as they began loading the supplies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think, noble sir,&rdquo; replied the youth, &ldquo;that
the Maiden in her pastoral life has had ample
opportunity to observe the wind and weather,
and is therefore able to predict changes like
these.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oho! Then she is an impostor!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why so, noble sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not understand? Does she not make
people believe that the winds change in answer to
her prayers?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, certainly not. She does not pray on
account of the wind. She prays because prayer is a
necessity to her, because of the impelling forces of
her nature, and because she feels happy in communing
with Heaven. Her special prayer is for strength
and help from on high for her great work, which is
beginning this very hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;H&rsquo;m! But she deceives the multitude by it,
just the same.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_81">81</div>
<p>&ldquo;She does only what she must do. Does the
sun lave itself every evening in the sea just because
the people believe it does?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not criticising you, my young friend, but
one minute you deny the supernatural in the manifestations
of the Maiden, and in the next you extol
her to the very skies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What are wonders anyway, noble sir? What
the blind multitude regards as a wonder easily
resolves itself into harmony with nature to the reflective
person, and what the multitude passes by
without observing at all is a wonder to the intelligent
thinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Explain yourself more clearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As to the first point, the Maiden herself is a
sufficient illustration. Do not these people recognize
a wonder in this change of wind, while you see
nothing at all extraordinary in it? As to the other
point there are a thousand illustrations. The sky
with its stars, the flowers of the field, the worm
in the dust,&mdash;all these are wonders of creation
which the multitude scarcely notices, but which
are marvellous to the observant thinker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And this Maiden?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_82">82</div>
<p>&ldquo;She is a wonder in both ways, and therein lies
her extraordinary power. She is believed to be
a prophetess who has direct communication with
Heaven. The people regard her as an actually
divine wonder, because of her purity of heart, her
celestial confidence, her unsullied patriotism, and her
spiritual illumination. Indeed, noble sir, the Maiden
is a wonderful gift of Heaven to stricken France.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then you also believe in her success apart from
her divine commission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not dispute her divine commission. She is
executing it because the divine voice in her own
heart has charged her with that duty. Do I believe
in her success? Look at these people! How
their eyes are fixed upon this Maiden! At her
command of &lsquo;forward&rsquo; they would plunge into the
Loire and follow her, believing that its waters would
bear them up. Will you not yourself, noble sir,
although you do not believe in her divine commission,
gladly draw your sword when the lily
banner waves before you? If the spirit which
Joan has roused in our little band is animating
all France, how can we do otherwise than expect
success?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are right, my young friend,&rdquo; said La Hire,
extending his hand. &ldquo;I thank your gallant father in
his grave for the training he gave you. Yes, yes, it
must be so,&mdash;when religious or political enthusiasms
fire a people, great results always follow. In this
case it is a joint enthusiasm. The victory will be
ours, and we shall thank the Maiden for it. I will
not again grieve her with my prayers. When it is
prayer time I will go so far off that she cannot hear
me. But one thing more, Jean. Have you heard
anything about Marie?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_83">83</div>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! noble sir, I have not. As you well know,
I have not ceased making inquiries, but as in your
case, the turmoil of war has prevented me from obtaining
personal information.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, I know. I cannot tell you how that
poor child&rsquo;s situation troubles me. I have waited
from week to week for an opportunity to speak a
few words to this lord of Luxemburg and his bishop&rdquo;&mdash;and
his grip of his sword indicated what kind of
words he had in mind. &ldquo;But let us hope,&rdquo; he resumed,
&ldquo;that the Maiden whom we serve may open
the way to Marie&rsquo;s release. First, we must send the
English to the devil. After that nothing shall prevent
me from finding Marie, and&rdquo;&mdash;casting a significant
glance at Jean&mdash;&ldquo;I know who will stand
by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the end of the world, noble sir,&rdquo; cried the
youth, his flashing eyes showing that the words came
from his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good, good, I am sure of it; but it is time
that we were off.&rdquo; He pointed to the last of the
vessels, which was held for the troops. Soon they
came to the line of the English intrenchments, which
stretched around the city.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_84">84</div>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; growled La Hire, &ldquo;these English gentlemen
do not like to show themselves, and yet it
would be an easy matter to break these nutshells.
I wonder if they have run away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are there, and can see us,&rdquo; said Jean.
&ldquo;They are lying behind the walls, but they have no
ordnance to use against us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It turned out as Jean said. The English made
no assault, and the little flotilla reached the city unharmed.
There was unbounded enthusiasm when
the Maiden appeared with her banner at the gates.
The people would have carried her in their arms had
not the commander of the city forestalled them by
having a horse in readiness for her. She mounted
and rode in triumph to the cathedral, where a <i>Te
Deum</i> was sung, the first which had been heard for
a long time within its walls. Then she was escorted
to the house of Jacques Boucher, treasurer of the
Duke of Orleans, where she was to lodge. Now
for the first time she put off her armor, drank a cup
of wine diluted with water, and then withdrew with
the wife and daughters of her host to her chamber.
There was lively commotion in the streets until far
into the night. All anxiety disappeared on that 29th
of April, 1429. An old chronicle relates that the
people and the soldiers believed an angel had come
down from heaven to them. To the same extent
that their despair had vanished and given place to
joyous enthusiasm, courage waned in the English
camp. Most of those brave soldiers, particularly
the spearsmen and archers, believed the Maiden was
either a messenger from heaven or from hell, either
a saint or a mighty magician. Their leaders inveighed
bitterly against the Dauphin because he
employed unknightly weapons, weapons of hell.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_85">85</div>
<p>On the next day Joan urged an immediate attack,
but at a council of the most experienced leaders it
was decided to wait at least for the arrival of the
next contingent of troops from Blois. They did not
altogether believe in Joan&rsquo;s divine commission, but
they thought it best to take advantage of the popular
enthusiasm which she had aroused. Count
Dunois returned to Blois to hasten reinforcements
forward, and on the fourth day his banner was seen
on the left bank of the Loire. His route led directly
past the English encampment. Joan could no longer
remain inactive. &ldquo;We must go out and meet them
and fetch them in,&rdquo; she cried, at the same time mounting
her steed, seizing her little battle-axe and banner,
and riding to the gate. The knights shook their
heads. No one was eager to rush directly into the
jaws of the lion, for it did not seem possible that any
one would come back if the English came out and
attacked them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_86">86</div>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; shouted La Hire, &ldquo;no one shall say
that La Hire has been outdone in courage by a
woman. Forward,&rdquo; he commanded, galloping after
the Maiden, and followed by his little band. Count
Dunois had halted some distance away, evidently
awaiting help from the city. As soon as he saw
the banners of the Maiden and La Hire he moved
forward along the first line of intrenchments. The
two forces soon met and advanced towards the city
along the very front of the English camp, but such
was the Englishmen&rsquo;s fear of the Maiden that not
one of them ventured out. No one even hurled a
missile. They looked on quietly, as the little band
passed their lines and safely reached the city. As
further reinforcements were on their way, it was
decided on the following day to attack Fort Saint
Loup.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, while Joan, wearied by her
exertions on the day before, was still sleeping, some
of the captains sallied out with their troops and
made a furious assault upon the fort. The English,
seeing only their customary assailants, fell upon
them, and after a hard struggle beat them back.
At that instant the Maiden, bearing her lily banner,
rode to the Burgundian gate. &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; she shouted
to the fugitives. &ldquo;Look you, the Maiden whom
God sent to you is here. Follow me to victory.&rdquo;
At once she plunged into the thick of battle. Her
presence acted like magic on both sides. The
French impetuously followed her, Daulon, Master
of horse, La Hire, and two other knights, leading
the first charge. The English wavered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_87">87</div>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you hesitate?&rdquo; cried Guerard, their
leader. &ldquo;Shame and confusion to any one who
fears this country girl! Drive her back to her village
and her father&rsquo;s cows.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His appeal was unheeded. The soldiers stood
for a moment staring at the banner in the hand of
&ldquo;the witch,&rdquo; and then, as if at the word of command,
rushed in a panic for the protecting walls of
the fort. &ldquo;On, my brave ones, forward to the
battle and victory,&rdquo; cried Joan, as she furiously galloped
after the fugitives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, soldiers of France!&rdquo; said La Hire, &ldquo;she
is doing more than her share. On, my children!
Shall we let this brave one do all the work alone?&rdquo;
He spurred his steed, but his heavy battle horse
could not overtake the Maiden&rsquo;s light courser. The
next instant a single knight of La Hire&rsquo;s troop flew
after her, and in a few seconds his sword was waving
at her side. It was Jean Renault. Enthusiasm
such as he had never felt before had seized him.
He was oblivious to all sense of danger. Scarcely
was the last Englishman through the fortress gate
before the Maiden and Jean rushed through also.
The astonished English soldiers saw the lily banner
in their very midst. Before they had recovered
from the deadly fear it inspired, it was flying on the
wall. The French poured through the gate, and
victory was soon complete. Those who resisted
were cut down, and the rest were taken prisoners.
Some of the fugitives had fled to the tower of the
church within the walls, but these unfortunates were
either killed upon the steps, or hurled themselves
from the windows. A more fortunate remnant
came out of the sacristy, where they had arrayed
themselves in the robes of the priests. These were
greeted with jibes and laughter as they begged of
the Maiden to be made prisoners. Amid the peals
of bells and the triumphal shouts of the people,
the Maiden entered the city at the head of her
soldiers.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_88">88</div>
<p>Three days after this&mdash;a festival day intervening&mdash;the
leaders decided to make a feint upon the right
bank, covering an attack upon the left. As Orleans
lies upon the right bank of the Loire, the commander
of the city kept a large number of boats for
crossing. In the midst of the stream, but somewhat
nearer the left bank, is an island which the English
had not occupied. The French landed upon this
island, Joan and La Hire, with his troop, in the
lead. The boats were fastened together and thus
made a bridge to the left bank, over which they advanced
for an attack upon the first fort, Le Blanc.
It would have been easy for the English to stop
the passage, but they did not attempt it. After
setting Fort Le Blanc on fire they fell back upon
Fort Saint Augustine.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_89">89</div>
<p>Joan followed them, and planted her banner half
an arrowshot&rsquo;s distance from the wall. Suddenly
there was a shout, &ldquo;The English are coming from
Fort St. Rivi.&rdquo; The little band retreated to the
Loire, all save fifteen, La Hire and Jean among
the latter. These fell back a little distance, so as
not to expose themselves needlessly to the enemy&rsquo;s
assault, seeing which the English plucked up
courage and attacked them, shouting loudly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; cried Joan, waving her banner and
advancing upon the English. The fifteen did not
hesitate, rash as the undertaking seemed. They
pressed forward, cutting their way through. When
those who had retreated to the river saw this they
came to their assistance, and in a few minutes the
English were driven back into the fort. Joan
rushed on until she reached the palisades, dashed
through a breach which Daulon had made, and
planted her banner on the wall. The French rapidly
came up, captured the fort, and burned it. It
may well be imagined this fresh victory was hailed
with delight in the city. The bells again pealed as
the soldiers entered, but their reception was a quiet
one as compared with the enthusiastic homage which
the Maiden received on her way to her lodgings.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_90">90</div>
<p>Though Joan was wounded in the foot during
the battle and passed a restless night, she was again
on horseback early in the morning. She rode to
the Burgundian Gate with a little band, and ordered
it to be opened. The keeper would not obey, saying
that the leaders had decided not to give battle
that day, and had ordered the gate to be kept
closed. When Joan insisted a tumult arose. The
people demanded it should be opened, and at last
opened it by force. With joyful acclamations the
crowd followed their inspired leader to the river.
The boats which had been used the day before
were lying there, and served this time to carry her
across. Joan held her horse by the bridle and let
it swim after her, and thus the left bank was reached.
A shout of joy from the French who had garrisoned
the captured fort welcomed the lily banner. They
came out to meet her, and Joan placed herself at
their head. &ldquo;Forward, my brave ones,&rdquo; she cried.
&ldquo;The victory to-day also will be ours.&rdquo; An enthusiastic
shout was the reply as they impetuously
rushed on to assault Fort Tournelles.</p>
<p>This fort, the strongest bulwark of the English,
was close to the river, a drawbridge furnishing the
only approach to it. On the land side it was surrounded
by a high wall, which had to be passed before
reaching the fort itself. Its garrison was the
very flower of the English warriors, led by the experienced
Glasdale. An assault by a mere handful
of troops without ordnance or storming appliances
seemed to the English the height of madness.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_91">91</div>
<p>In the meantime the number of the assailants
continually increased, for when the leaders in
Orleans witnessed the courageous dash of the
Maiden they realized that they must support her.
One after another La Hire, Dunois the Bastard
of Orleans, De Retz, Gaucourt, Gamache, Graville,
Tintey, Villars, Chailly, Couraze, D&rsquo;Illiers,
Thermes, Gontaut, Eulant, Saintrailles, and others
appeared upon the scene. By ten o&rsquo;clock the assault
was general. The French hurled long spears.
The English brandished leaden maces and iron
battle-axes and hurled beams, stones, boiling oil,
and molten lead upon the heads of the assailants.
After three hours of furious fighting the French fell
back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Courage,&rdquo; cried Joan, whose banner was always
in the front. &ldquo;Courage in God&rsquo;s name. The victory
is ours.&rdquo; She rushed to a ladder and ascended.
&ldquo;Surrender!&rdquo; she shouted to the English, &ldquo;or you
will be massacred.&rdquo; The reply was an arrow, which
pierced her shoulder so that it protruded five inches
out of her back. She gave a cry of pain and came
down to the trenches. The English rushed upon
her furiously, but a hand was stretched out to her
at once. A heavy battle-axe struck her protector
down. It was the brave Gamache who had come
to her rescue. In a trice other heroes were on the
spot, and the English fell back. They bore the
maiden tenderly away and took off her armor. She
looked up with tearful eyes, but they were fixed
upon heaven, as was her wont.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_92">92</div>
<p>&ldquo;How is it going, Count Dunois?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have ordered a retreat,&rdquo; he replied, whereupon
she partly sprang up, seized the arrow with
both hands, and pulled it out. &ldquo;Let there be no
retreating,&rdquo; she urged. &ldquo;Quick, my armor.&rdquo; In
a few minutes she mounted her steed and galloped
through the flying ranks. &ldquo;Halt!&rdquo; she pleaded.
&ldquo;Have courage, in God&rsquo;s name. In half an hour
the English will be in our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The effect of her heroic resolution was wonderful.
The soldiers turned back with cheers. Daulon
grasped the lily banner and carried it to the wall.
Joan hastened forward and again led the assault.
The terror of the English at the reappearance of the
Maiden cannot be described. They had believed
her dead. They were certain now that she was in
league with Satan. They dropped their weapons
and fled, and fear lent wings to their flight. Loud
cries of horror from the water side completed the
disasters of the day. An attack had been made
upon the drawbridge. Glasdale had hastened there
to protect the weak point. A shot fired by Daulon
shattered the pier, and the bridge with all its defenders
fell with a crash into the Loire. Glasdale,
weighed down by his heavy armor, was drowned.
It was this disaster which had caused the outcries.
The day ended in a tragedy for the English. &ldquo;Save
yourselves as you can,&rdquo; was the signal for flight.
The fort was taken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_93">93</div>
<p>In Orleans the bells rang welcome to the troops.
They rang the whole night long in celebration
of the victory. The churches were thronged, and
from thousands of grateful hearts rose the <i>Te Deum
laudamus</i> to heaven. The next morning dense
smoke ascended from the English camp. Suffolk
and Talbot had abandoned the siege, set fire to
their camp, and retreated with the remnant of their
army.</p>
<p>Thus in nine days Joan accomplished the first
part of her mission.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_94">94</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="h2line1">Chapter V</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Coronation and the Capture</span></h2>
<p>On the left bank of the Loire, a few miles
above Orleans, is the little city of Jargeau.
At the time of which we write it was surrounded
by massive walls, and was considered
a strong fortress. After the raising of the
siege of Orleans the weakness of their position was
so apparent that the Duke of Suffolk, with his
brothers, Alexander and John de la Pole, fell back
to Jargeau. Within a few weeks the Maid of Orleans,
as Joan was now generally called, was before its walls
with her principal commanders. Her only desire
now was to conduct the King to Rheims for his
coronation. Notwithstanding her wounds were not
yet healed, she left Orleans with La Hire, Dunois,
the Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on, and other officers, went to
Tours, where the Dauphin was then stopping, and
requested him to follow her at once to Rheims. He
was not disposed, however, to grant her request. His
kitchen, cellar, and money-chest were once more replenished,
and as life was now very enjoyable, he
decided that it would be rash to hazard such an
undertaking until the way was cleared; for notwithstanding
the deliverance of Orleans, the enemy
was still holding the district. The leaders also declared
that it would be in violation of all the rules
of war. They must first open the way, and above
all, Jargeau must be captured. Joan was obliged to
submit to their decision, and join them.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_95">95</div>
<p>On the 20th of June&mdash;the day was Friday&mdash;the
army arrived before Jargeau. Learning that Falstaff
was on his way from Paris with help for Suffolk, no
time was wasted. Preparations for the assault were
instantly begun, and on Saturday evening a breach
had been made in the wall. Early on Sunday morning
Joan, in full armor, entered the tent of d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on,
he being in chief command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, noble Duke,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;let us make
the attack.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;to-day? On Sunday?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not, noble sir? Obedience is the best
service to God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, Joan, is the breach passable?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly. God has given the enemy into
our hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, in the meantime&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no meantime, noble sir. What fear
you? Have you forgotten that I promised to take
you back safe to your wife?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, let the attack begin.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_96">96</div>
<p>&ldquo;Forward, attack!&rdquo; cried Joan, as she left the
tent, waving her banner. The troops advanced,
but the apprehensions of the Duke proved to be
well founded. The breach was too high. A ladder
must be raised. In the meantime, among the daring
ones who had rushed forward, was Jean. &ldquo;Halt,
boy,&rdquo; shouted La Hire, at the same time pulling
him back. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think your skull is tough
enough to resist that fellow&rsquo;s club.&rdquo; He pointed to
the breach. Jean looked up and saw a giant standing
in the opening, wielding a massive club, and
laughing with fiendish glee as he dashed everything
about him to pieces. &ldquo;Wait a bit,&rdquo; said La Hire.
&ldquo;I think your namesake, the gunner, can stop that
fellow&rsquo;s laughing.&rdquo; He was right. The catapult
hurled a rock through the air, the giant flung up his
arms, and fell backward from the wall, a great shout
accompanying his fall.</p>
<p>Joan rushed up the ladder shouting &ldquo;Forward,
forward, my brave ones,&rdquo; but a stone felled her to
the earth.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; shouted the English, &ldquo;the witch is
dead.&rdquo; Their joy was short-lived, however. Fear
again seized them, as they not only heard her assuring
words to those about her, but saw her prepare to
ascend the ladder again.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_97">97</div>
<p>&ldquo;All right now, boy,&rdquo; said La Hire, as Jean again
rushed forward. &ldquo;I am with you this time.&rdquo; They
quickly climbed the ladder, but when Jean reached
the top some of the English had been thrown
down, and others were flying into the city. Among
those who had been hurled down was Alexander
de la Pole. When the Duke of Suffolk saw his
brother fallen, and the French pouring in, he gave
up the fight, and, like the others, turned toward
the city.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Halt! halt! surrender!&rdquo; a strong voice shouted.
Suffolk stopped and looked at his pursuer. He
could have vanquished him with little effort, but he
did not consider it chivalrous to take advantage of
an enemy. &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jean Renault,&rdquo; was the answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nobleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Knight?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Kneel down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean obeyed. The Duke raised his sword, and with
the words, &ldquo;In the name of God and Saint George
I dub thee knight,&rdquo; he dealt him three blows upon
the shoulder with the flat of the blade, and then
offered him his sword.</p>
<p>Jean arose, pressed the Duke&rsquo;s hand to his lips,
and took his sword, saying, &ldquo;I do not deserve this
honor, my Lord Duke, but I am very proud to
receive the sword of the first of England&rsquo;s heroes.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_98">98</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; said a deep voice behind him;
and, as if in benediction, La Hire laid his mailed
hand upon his head. &ldquo;You are right, say I. All
the knighthood of France would begrudge you
this sword. By Saint George, I am just as happy
as if I had seen that sword in the hand of my own
son.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The noble La Hire&rsquo;s word,&rdquo; said the Duke,
&ldquo;is sufficient warrant that my sword will be worthily
carried, Sir Jean Renault; there is no stain upon
it, guard its purity.&rdquo; Jean&rsquo;s feelings overcame him,
and he could make no reply.</p>
<p>After the capture of Jargeau, Joan rested for a
time, meanwhile forwarding reinforcements to Orleans,
for more victories must yet be achieved in the
district of the Loire. While her fame attracted recruits
every day to her banner, the fear of her very
name was so overpowering that Meung, Beaugency,
Guetin, and other cities surrendered without offering
resistance. The English force which came from
Paris under Talbot and Falstaff was defeated at
Patay, and two of its generals were taken prisoners.
The evacuation of Paris was the result of this
battle.<a class="fn" id="fr_25" href="#fn_25">[25]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_99">99</div>
<p>Joan returned with the Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on to Orleans,
and thence repaired to Gien to see the Dauphin.
&ldquo;Sire,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;the district of the Loire is now
clear. Go with me to your coronation at Rheims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dauphin still hesitated. &ldquo;The way is even
yet dangerous,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Many castles and cities
in Champagne are still in the hands of the enemy.
How easy it would be for them to fall upon our rear
from Normandy.&rdquo; His councillors in attendance
decided that his fears were well grounded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you saints of heaven,&rdquo; cried the Maiden,
her eyes shining with enthusiasm, &ldquo;help me to
inspire the noble Dauphin with a little of that
courage you have given me!&rdquo; Her prayer was
answered at once. The King was moved by her
soulful eyes, her steadfast faith, and her lofty inspiration.
&ldquo;Yes, Joan, we will trust you,&rdquo; he exclaimed.
&ldquo;On to Rheims.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Orders were sent in all directions. The leaders
and their troops quickly assembled, and the march
began. Joan led the vanguard. At the mere announcement
of her coming the cities of Auxerre, St.
Florentin, Chalons, and Sept-Sceaux capitulated.
Troyes did not surrender until preparations for
assault were made. At Sept-Sceaux, four leagues
from Rheims, they rested. Charles then sent three
of his principal councillors to San Remy to fetch
the holy oil which was kept there.<a class="fn" id="fr_26" href="#fn_26">[26]</a> They returned,
escorted by a grand procession headed by the Abbot
of San Remy, who walked under a canopy, carrying
the phial.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_100">100</div>
<p>From all the towers of Rheims the bells announced
the memorable ceremony of July 17, 1429, which
completed Joan&rsquo;s mission. The pealing organ and
a majestic hymn of praise welcomed the long coronation
procession as it entered the Cathedral of St.
Denis. Joan accompanied the King to the vestibule,
where the Archbishop of Rheims met him and conducted
him to the high altar. The choir was occupied
on each side by the commanders and leading
dignitaries, knights and lords, squires and attendants,
while a vast multitude of people crowded the
cathedral to its utmost capacity. Joan stood next
to the King, her eyes shining with sacred joy, holding
her banner in her left hand and her sword in
her right.<a class="fn" id="fr_27" href="#fn_27">[27]</a>
It was a position which ordinarily only
the first marshals of the kingdom were entitled to
occupy; but no one questioned her right to it or
envied her.</p>
<div class="img" id="pic3">
<img src="images/p01.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="871" />
<p class="caption"><i>The last act in the ceremony was Charles&rsquo;s coronation</i></p>
</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_101">101</div>
<p>The sacred function began at nine o&rsquo;clock in the
morning and lasted until two o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon.
The opening ceremony was the administering
of the oath by the Archbishop, during which
Joan, following the old custom, held her sword
over the King&rsquo;s head. Then followed the knighting,
for Charles had not yet received this honor,
without which he could not ascend the throne. He
knelt and the Duc d&rsquo;Alen&ccedil;on knighted him. The
third ceremony was the consecration and anointing
with the holy oil, and was performed by the Archbishop.
The last act was his coronation by the
same prelate. As soon as the royal symbol glittered
upon his head the cathedral resounded with the
enthusiastic acclamations of the great multitude:
&ldquo;Hail, hail, King Charles the Seventh!&rdquo; accompanied
by a fanfare of trumpets, the roll of drums,
and majestic chorales.</p>
<p>Joan was the first to proclaim allegiance to the
Crown. She threw herself at the King&rsquo;s feet, and
after kissing his knee, said: &ldquo;Sire, the will of God
is accomplished. You are now the true King of
France. My mission is ended. Permit me to
return to my home and resume the humble life of
the shepherdess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, Joan,&rdquo; replied the King, &ldquo;I cannot spare
you. All that I now am is due to you. You must
accompany me on the return.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_102">102</div>
<p>Joan rose sadly. She felt that in remaining longer
she would be disobeying the divine voices which
had commissioned her to perform only the two
tasks now successfully accomplished. The King
rewarded her by granting a patent of nobility to her
whole family, whence it is that she is called &ldquo;Jeanne
d&rsquo;Arc.&rdquo; Her coat of arms was a blue shield with
two gold lilies and a silver sword bearing a golden
crown on its point. These distinctions, however,
were of little interest to Joan. She grew sadder and
sadder, and ardently longed for her home fields and
her loved Fairy Tree. This feeling became all the
more intense when her brother Pierre arrived; but
she rushed joyously into his arms and was somewhat
consoled when the King appointed him her
page, and she knew that he would never leave her.
She took part in many more military operations; but
although she entered many cities whose gates opened
at the sound of her name, though she was everywhere
greeted as a saint and welcomed with enthusiastic
acclamations and songs of praise, she no longer
felt the early unquestioning faith and the sacred
inspiration. An ill-starred movement against Paris,
in which she was wounded afresh, confirmed her in
the belief that she had exceeded her duty, and that
she was no longer under the protection of her saints.
She was haunted with gloomy presentiments of
death. They pursued her in dreams, and at last
she again implored the King to let her go.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_103">103</div>
<p>&ldquo;What do you fear, Joan?&rdquo; said the King. &ldquo;If
you are wounded it shall be my care to heal you.
If you are captured by the English I will release
you, if it costs half my kingdom. You are the
guardian angel of France. I cannot let you go.&rdquo;
He placed her in command of his own corps and
sent her once more into the tumult of battle.</p>
<p>On the 27th of May Joan appeared with her
army before Compi&egrave;gne,<a class="fn" id="fr_28" href="#fn_28">[28]</a>
which was occupied by the
French but was closely invested by the Duke of
Burgundy, who was in alliance with the English.
She successfully entered the city, and of course was
received with the greatest enthusiasm. Early on
the next day she made a sally at the head of six
hundred troopers. She wore her usual armor, with
a short silver-gilt cape over it, and carried her small
battle-axe, sword, and banner.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_104">104</div>
<p>Philip of Burgundy&rsquo;s army was composed of
experienced troops, and its various divisions were
led by Noyelles, John of Luxemburg, and John
of Montgomery. Joan swept among them like a
whirlwind, carrying everything before her, and for
the time throwing them into utter confusion. A
cry of terror&mdash;&ldquo;The Maiden, the Maiden&rdquo;&mdash;was
raised in the camp, but when Philip of Burgundy
appeared with reinforcements the English, recovering
from their first surprise and confusion, began
to hold their ground. Finding herself confronted
by a tenfold increased force, she ordered a retreat.
She was the last in the line, and was closely pressed
by the enemy, but when the boldest of them came
too close she turned upon them and drove them
back. In this manner she forced her way successfully
to the gate. As there was much crowding
and disorder there, she turned once more at the
head of her rear guard against her pursuers, and
beat them back, thus gaining time for her troopers
to get into the city; but when she herself made a
dash for the gate she found an English troop barring
the way. She slashed right and left and hewed
her way through; but, alas! the gate was shut. No
one heard her call, no one opened the gate, for it was
feared that the English might rush through. Joan
turned her horse, hoping to reach open country or find
another gate. The enemy, seeing that she rode alone,
plucked up courage. She was quickly surrounded,
and a desperate fight ensued. An archer stole
under her horse, seized her by her velvet cape, and
pulled her down. She gathered all her strength
for a last effort, but, overcome by superior numbers,
sank exhausted upon her knee, and still
fought on with her little remaining strength. Longingly
she watched the city, but no one came to
her rescue. At last she surrendered her sword
to Lionel, one of the leaders in the Duke of Luxemburg&rsquo;s
corps.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_105">105</div>
<p>&ldquo;The Maiden is captured,&rdquo; shouted the soldiers.
The news flew from place to place and from troop
to troop. The English celebrated the event with as
much enthusiasm as if they had won a pitched battle.
Well might they rejoice, for Joan&rsquo;s prowess had
cost them two-thirds of their French possessions.</p>
<p>The Duke of Bedford, the Earl of Warwick,
and the Bishop of Winchester instructed Brother
Martin, Vicar General of the Inquisition, to demand
the delivery of &ldquo;the witch&rdquo; into the hands
of the Church. Martin wrote to the Duke of
Burgundy as follows:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;By virtue of the regulations of our order and of the
Holy Roman See which give us the authority, we entreat
and command, under lawful penalties, that you deliver to
us the prisoner, the Maiden Joan, who is suspected of heresy,
that she may be proceeded against in the Court of the
Holy Inquisition.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Both of us know,&rdquo; said the Duke of Burgundy
to John of Luxemburg, &ldquo;that Joan is not a witch
but a noble maiden, and that we are bound to deliver
all noble prisoners to our English allies for a
consideration of ten thousand pounds. But we also
know that the Maiden is an exception, as it is
altogether probable that Charles VII will ransom
her, for he has promised to do so.&rdquo; John of Luxemburg
was satisfied, as he hoped to get more from
the King than from the English. In the meantime
he sent Joan to his castle Beaurevoir, where she was
affectionately greeted by his wife.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_106">106</div>
<p>Month after month passed, but nothing was
heard from Charles VII. In the luxurious life he
was leading he had not time to think of his rescuer,
whom he had promised to ransom even if it
cost him half his kingdom. For this reason the
English were anxious to expedite matters. They
instructed Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais, in whose
diocese Joan had been captured, to request her
delivery to him and to conduct her examination.
They offered ten thousand pounds to the Duke of
Luxemburg, the ransom price of a general, and an
annuity of three hundred pounds to Duke Lionel.
In the middle of September the Duke of Luxemburg
sent word to his wife he could wait no longer,
but by her earnest pleading and by her excuse that
the Duke of Bedford had not yet sent the money,
she secured a further respite for Joan.</p>
<p>Joan burst into tears as she now for the first time
realized the actual character of the situation. &ldquo;Oh,
I knew it would be so!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;They
have sold me, but I would rather die than be given
into the hands of the English.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_107">107</div>
<p>One stormy November evening the castle guards
heard a scream which was audible even above the
howling of the gale. They rushed to the spot and
found Joan in the moat. She had thrown herself
from her window, but she had failed in her purpose.
She was not dead. The event made the avaricious
master of the castle fearful that he might lose his
reward entirely, for how could he give security that
this desperate maiden, in spite of the utmost watchfulness,
might not carry out her purpose yet?</p>
<p>A few weeks later the rabble of Rouen stood
before an iron cage suspended from a tower. Derisive
epithets and cruel insults passed from lip to
lip and were greeted with indecent laughter. In
a corner of the cage sat a cowering figure bound with
fetters. Her face could not be seen, for her head
was bowed in anguish. One of the mob thrust his
lance toward her to make her look up. He was
successful. She slowly raised her head, and the
crowd looked upon eyes full of sorrow, eyes full of
purity and beauty,&mdash;the eyes of Joan. The Duke
of Luxemburg had completed his infamous bargain.
He had delivered her to the English.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_108">108</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VI</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Martyrdom</span></h2>
<p>Jean Renault sat in a tavern at Chinon,
abstractedly gazing out over the flowery fields
which were visible from his windows. It was
a day in May, 1431, and the time and the scene
painfully reminded him this was the third spring
since the incidents in the forest and the Ursuline
church. He was not a dreamer, however, but a man
of quick and resolute action. It was the thought
that he had been prevented from accomplishing the
purpose upon which his heart was set that made
him gloomy and abstracted. A heavy step interrupted
his reverie.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ha! the villain,&rdquo; exclaimed La Hire, as he
entered, almost beside himself with rage. &ldquo;The
sordid, venal wretch! The dishonorable scoundrel,
who would sell that noble one for contemptible
gold! But just let him wait! I am searching for
him and I am on his track!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Noble sir,&rdquo; interrupted Jean, &ldquo;of whom speak
you?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_109">109</div>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom am I speaking? Of whom else than
Luxemburg? That&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! of him! I too was thinking of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can well believe it, my boy,&rdquo; for although
Jean was now a knight, La Hire continued to
call him &ldquo;my boy.&rdquo; &ldquo;I cannot sleep because of it.
Shame and disgrace upon him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish we had been at Compi&egrave;gne. Then we
should have had a chance to meet him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes, to meet him&mdash;but the poor Maiden!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, the poor Maiden! I was also thinking of
her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She languishes in a gloomy prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, in a gloomy prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her delicate limbs are loaded with fetters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, loaded with fetters!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condemned to bread and water, like a felon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Condemned to bread and water!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She, the rescuer of France!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom speak you, noble sir?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of whom do I speak? Saint George, of whom
else than Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of Joan? I thought it was of&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, you were thinking of Marie! The poor
child! May God&rsquo;s vengeance overtake Luxemburg!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what about Joan?&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_110">110</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not know? Why, of course you do
not, for I have not told you. He has given her
up, sold her to the English, the villain!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has?&rdquo; cried the astonished Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Duke of Luxemburg.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help her! And the King?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pah! the King! He doesn&rsquo;t care.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the shame!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, the disgrace!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But by what legal authority have they put Joan
in prison?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By what legal authority? Ask the priests who
have condemned her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The priests!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The vengeful English have given her to the
Holy Inquisition. The Bishop of Beauvais conducted
the proceedings, and she has been sentenced
to life imprisonment for heresy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To life imprisonment! But how could they
convict her of heresy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They did not convict her. That simple child
refuted every charge made against her by her sensible
and devout replies to the questions they asked her.
They condemned her upon the charge of having
intercourse with evil spirits.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shameful, it is shameful!&rdquo; cried Jean, springing
up in a rage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, horrible!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Farewell, noble sir.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_111">111</div>
<p>&ldquo;What? Whither go you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To Rouen. You must let me go. I shall not
ask the King.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what will you do in Rouen?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Summon help if it be possible. Rescue Joan
even if it should cost my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Would that I could go with you! But I
could be of no service. You will not accomplish
your purpose, my boy. They have not only selected
a special tower for her prison, but they have
securely bound her with chains fastened to a post
that cannot be reached by you. And there are two
guards constantly on the watch outside and three
inside the prison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But even that, noble sir, does not discourage
me. It only makes me the more eager to be off;
and there is something else that urges me on to
Rouen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God go with you, my boy. But I
warn you to be careful. I wish I could go also.
I would ask you to wait until I can be there, but
it would not be right. You have waited too long
already.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_112">112</div>
<p>On the next day Jean rode to Rouen in the disguise
of a peasant. While going through the recovered
districts he rode as fast as the strength of
his horse would permit, following the same circuitous
route which he took on his first journey.
On the last stretch he made a still wider detour,
which brought him into his own neighborhood,
where he met peasants of his acquaintance, as he
had expected. He left his horse with them and pursued
his way on foot to Rouen. That city, as well
as its vicinity, was in the hands of the enemy, and
was so strongly garrisoned that little but English was
heard on the streets,&mdash;a fact which caused Jean much
misgiving. His appearance, however, did not excite
attention, for intercourse between city and country
had gradually been restored, and the peasants were
freely bringing in their products for the market.</p>
<p>Jean&rsquo;s first move was to the church of Saint
Ursula. There, at the place by the wall which was
so familiar to him, he fell upon his knees, but he
could not pray. He could hear his heart beating
as he listened; but when he found that he was
listening in vain and that there was no sign of life
on the other side of the wall, he became more composed,
and prayed fervently to Heaven for help.
Upon his return to his lodgings he passed himself
off for one of the curious crowd which was pouring
in from near and far to see &ldquo;the witch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have come here to little purpose, good
friend,&rdquo; said his host, &ldquo;and yet there are some
sights which will repay you. You can see the cage
in which the prisoner was fastened, and the tower in
which she is still confined.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_113">113</div>
<p>&ldquo;Is no one allowed to enter the tower? I would
be satisfied if I could see her even from a distance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what are you thinking of? No one
should be allowed to see her, for she has intercourse
with evil spirits! How easy it would be for
one of those spirits to assume the appearance of a
peasant and join a crowd of curious people, just as
if it were one of them! Now the prison door
opens! Hush! the spirit gets in there! and ps-t&mdash;they
are gone. Do you see? That is the way
with witches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is that so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes! My grandmother, blessed&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this instant the loquacious host was called
out. When he returned he had forgotten his story
in his eagerness to make an announcement to his
guest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a very lucky man,&rdquo; he said, beaming
with delight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How so?&rdquo; replied Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, look you! I thought I was too when I
heard the news. I am perfectly delighted that you
did not lodge with that pitiful fellow, Loup. Between
ourselves, I can&rsquo;t endure that man. He has
recently&mdash;but I will tell you about that another
time. What was I saying? Oh, yes! Look,
there comes my cousin, the dear, good woman!
You cannot imagine how pious she is. His reverence,
the Bishop, could tell you. Why, he has
even taken her confessions many a time himself!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_114">114</div>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, but what does all this mean?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, it means good news. I have stolen away
to tell you, for it is still a secret, and my cousin has
promised his reverence not to breathe a word of it
to any one, and she first told Charlotte&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But what is this secret?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, what do you think? The witch has
actually had intercourse with evil spirits in the
prison!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! How do you know that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How? My cousin could tell you exactly. Let
me see, how was it? Oh, yes; I have it. The
witch had promised to renounce all her hellish
practices and wear women&rsquo;s clothes. So they were
brought into the prison; but notwithstanding that
she was found the next morning with men&rsquo;s clothes
on again. There you have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why do you conclude from that that she
has intercourse with evil spirits?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why? Do you still doubt? Holy Ursula!
his reverence says so. My cousin, the good
woman, she could tell you all about it; but she
has gone just now to mass.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you were going to tell me some good
news.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_115">115</div>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes; I had nearly forgotten it. It is this.
As the witch has resumed her intercourse with the
evil spirits, she will have to be tried again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, of what interest is that to me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of what interest is it to you? Holy Ursula!
Is it not of the greatest interest to you that you
have not come here in vain? When they sentence
the witch again, she will stand upon a high platform,
as she did the first time, and you will see her
just as easily as you see me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So! That is nice. But when will it be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know, little friend. But, ps-t, my
cousin will find out all about it from his reverence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the Bishop here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet; but if he does not come to-day, he will
be here in the morning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, surely, I arrived here at just the right
time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did I not tell you so? I am so glad you are
not stopping with that disagreeable Loup, for he
could not have told you a word about this matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course not. He has not such a pious cousin
who confesses to his reverence himself. But can I
go now and see the tower and the cage?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly, little friend; but listen. If you should
meet that Loup, do not greet him, do not even look
at him, for they say he has an evil eye&mdash;he might
bewitch you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will keep it in mind.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_116">116</div>
<p>To his great disappointment Jean found the
tower so well guarded that he could not be of the
slightest assistance to Joan. He decided to withdraw
and await events before forming any plans, and
in the meantime make inquiries about Marie. While
on his way back he heard from passers-by that the
Bishop was momentarily expected, and that he would
pass that way. As he did not wish unnecessarily to
expose himself to the prelate&rsquo;s gaze, he entered the
Ursuline church. It was empty. He went to the
usual spot, and scarcely had he placed his ear to
the wall before he clearly heard a sob, which seemed
to come through the stone. Trembling with excitement,
he listened all the more intently, but in vain.
All was silent. Had he or had he not been deceived?
All at once it seemed to him as if it were
the voice of the girl in the carriage which he met in
the forest, and that she could be no other than
Marie of Chafleur. He quickly made his plans.
As he stood leaning against a door, near which he
had been kneeling apparently engaged in devotion,
he pressed a piece of wax against the lock, went at
once to a locksmith&rsquo;s in an out of the way street,
and said his master wished a key made from the
impression.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_117">117</div>
<p>The next evening, when all Rouen was out to see
the young King Henry of England make his entrance,
Jean again found the church empty. He
tried his key and it opened the door. He emerged
into a long, dark passage-way which skirted the
wall. If he was right in his calculations, he would
find the prison between this passage and the church.
He felt along the wall, for he could see nothing.
He was right. There was a door near the corner.
It must lead to the prison out of which had come
the sound of sobbing. With trembling hand he
took another impression, groped his way back,
closed the door in the church wall, and departed.
The next day he obtained the second key. He now
forsook the church for a time and devoted his attention
exclusively to the fate of Joan. The strangest
reports were circulated about her; but they were
so incredible and withal so dreadful, that he paid
little attention to them. What pained him the
most was the certainty that he could do nothing to
help her.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_118">118</div>
<p>Thus matters stood on that 30th of May of the
memorable year 1431. The sun gayly shone that
morning, and the birds sang joyously in the trees
and among the flowers. The doors of Rouen stood
wide open. From far and near the multitude
gathered. There was a sea of heads on the sides of
the great market-place, and in the streets leading to
it, and windows and roof-tops were crowded. In
the middle of the square were three high platforms.
Two of them, which faced each other, were evidently
set apart for those directly concerned in the proceedings.
The general interest centred, however, in the
third platform, of the use of which there could be
no doubt. The flooring rested upon a pile of wood
so arranged that the logs made steps, and from the
centre of the platform rose a stake to a man&rsquo;s height.
The base of the pile was surrounded with bundles
of fagots smeared with resin and pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come on, little friend,&rdquo; said the innkeeper to
Jean, as he went up some stairs. &ldquo;I have a nice
place for seeing. I am so glad you did not stop
with that miserable Loup&mdash;but, holy Ursula! are
you ill? Your hand is as cold as ice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not feeling very well,&rdquo; replied Jean, &ldquo;and
I would rather go back again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! You don&rsquo;t mean to leave just as the
spectacle begins! I will get a little potion for you
which my cousin, the good woman&mdash;but, holy Ursula!
the drums are already rattling. The judges
are mounting the great tribunal. Look, there is
his reverence. He has the parchment in his hand
which contains the sentence. Pay attention. He
will read it soon.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Jean did not hear a word. His eyes were fixed
upon a distant spot whence, accompanied by the
roll of drums and the shouts of the multitude, a
procession was slowly making its way through the
crowd.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_119">119</div>
<p>&ldquo;Do you see the cart?&rdquo; said the innkeeper.
&ldquo;Do you see the witch in it? She is sitting by
the side of Father Martin. That holy man has been
praying by her side all night that the evil spirit
may forsake her. Holy Ursula! See how they
have bound her! Her hands are fastened, and her
feet are in iron rings with a chain between.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The cart soon reached the square. Joan was
led up to the second platform by Father Martin.
The Bishop of Beauvais read the sentence amid the
profound silence of the multitude:</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of God, Amen.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We, the Bishop of Beauvais, Master and Vicar
of the Inquisition, pronounce sentence. As Joan,
commonly called &lsquo;the Maiden,&rsquo; has relapsed into
heresy and apostasy, she is excommunicated, and
herewith given over to the secular power for the
infliction of the punishment provided for the heretic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some would have applauded, but they found no
encouragement, for Joan had fallen upon her knees
and was praying, and when she raised her head her
face was as the face of an angel. Many began to
realize that she was not a criminal, and loud sobs,
indicating the growing change of feeling, were heard
here and there. Observing this, the judges hastened
their work. An attendant approached her and
placed a pointed cap on her head with the words,
&ldquo;Heretic, relapser, apostate, idolatress,&rdquo; written upon
it. He then hurried her down the steps and led
her to the pile, at the foot of which the executioner
was in waiting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_120">120</div>
<p>&ldquo;Leave me not, Father Martin,&rdquo; she implored,
as the executioner seized her and dragged her up
to the platform. The father followed and remained
with her as the executioner bound her to the stake
and then turned to descend.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray for me, all pray for me,&rdquo; she cried to the
people.</p>
<p>The executioner seized a torch and lit the fagots
at the foot of the pile. Swiftly rose the flames.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, my father,&rdquo; cried Joan, &ldquo;take
care! Quick, quick, hurry down, but hold the crucifix
high before me until I die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Martin did as she requested. The Bishop of
Beauvais approached.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bishop, Bishop,&rdquo; said Joan, reproachfully, &ldquo;you
are the cause of my death,&rdquo; and then as she felt the
heat, she exclaimed, &ldquo;O Rouen, I fear you will
have to suffer for my death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The flames mounted higher. A dense cloud of
smoke concealed her, but now and then the wind
swept it aside, and the people saw, not a devil&rsquo;s
witch, but a praying angel with marvellously beautiful
eyes fixed upon heaven. Suddenly the flames
seized her garments. Her last word was &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;then
a piercing death cry, and all was ended.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_121">121</div>
<p>Thus perished the Maid of Orleans, rescuer of
France. She died forgotten and forsaken by him
for whom she had done all, betrayed through the
greed of her own countrymen, accused from motives
of revenge by her enemies. She died the most
cruel of deaths, and yet was as guileless and pure
as when she sat under the Fairy Tree tending her
lambs. Joan is a unique figure in the world&rsquo;s history.
A simple peasant maiden, who could neither
read nor write, and knew only the Lord&rsquo;s Prayer,
the Credo, and the Ave Maria, she achieved such
extraordinary results by her gift of inspiration that
her contemporaries and posterity in their efforts to
explain them have had to attribute so much of the
miraculous to her deeds that some have doubted
her very existence.</p>
<p>The old market-place of Rouen now presented
another spectacle. &ldquo;Alas! alas! we have burned a
saint,&rdquo; many said. The crowd remained a long
time, as if riveted to the spot, staring at the fire as
it consumed the last vestiges of the victim.</p>
<p>The innkeeper himself was so overcome that he
forgot all about his companion. When he turned
to speak to him, Jean was gone.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_122">122</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="h2line1">Chapter VII</span>
<br /><span class="h2line2">The Rescue</span></h2>
<p>Marie of Chafleur had borne her imprisonment
with unshaken courage.
She was resolved that she would not
be forced to take the vow, and though
she suffered greatly in her damp, gloomy prison,&mdash;she
who could still take childish delight in every
little flower,&mdash;she remained true to her resolution.</p>
<p>The Abbess, who had been so favorably impressed
by her when they first met, was still more impressed
by her firmness, and gave her permission to visit
her. Upon one such occasion the abbess kindly
said: &ldquo;You grieve me, my daughter. Your obstinacy
may compel me to adopt severe measures.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie made no reply. She was looking out of
the open window at the garden, which was now in
full bloom, and was so absorbed with the view that
she did not hear the Abbess. Her face was all aglow
with excitement, her eyes sparkled, and she gleefully
clapped her hands. &ldquo;Oh, how beautiful, how beautiful!&rdquo;
she cried, approaching nearer to the window.
&ldquo;Oh, if I could but be among those flowers!&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_123">123</div>
<p>&ldquo;You are childish,&rdquo; said the Abbess, without
manifesting displeasure, however. &ldquo;Listen, and pay
attention to what I say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie wiped away her rising tears and looked
into the Abbess&rsquo;s face. &ldquo;It is not very long ago
that you were as young as I,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and, oh,
how beautiful you must have been without that
veil! Tell me, have you never enjoyed yourself
in the flowery meadows? Have you never chased
the pretty butterflies, never listened to the songs
of the birds, never breathed the fragrance of the
flowers? Oh, tell me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why do you call up such recollections, child?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, I know you have, and so you can understand
me when I tell you it is impossible for me
to stay within these walls. I must go. Surely,
noble lady, you will not keep me here any longer.
Oh, open the doors and let me out. I will go on
foot and travel through the country all alone until I
find my uncle. And even should I not find him,
and have to suffer hunger, thirst, cold, and heat,
still I should be happy. So once more, noble lady,
I implore you to let me go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, child, you are asking impossibilities of
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why impossible?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have no idea of the implicit obedience
required of us.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_124">124</div>
<p>&ldquo;But, noble lady, your vows and your discipline
only bind you in your relations to the convent life,
not to the outer world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are mistaken, my daughter. We owe unquestioning
obedience in all things to our superiors.
Whatever they demand of us is right. It is not for
us to question or decide.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that, noble lady? Having dedicated
yourself to Heaven, can you blindly follow human
dictation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child, the will of the Church, to which we bow,
is the will of Heaven.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not understand that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is because you are not in the right spirit
to understand it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That may be true, but I am sure of one thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That you would not poison me even if you
were ordered to do so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Child,&rdquo; said the astonished Abbess, &ldquo;what put
such a dreadful thought as that in your mind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because, though unconsciously, you have really
begun to do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shock me! What do you mean? That
I would poison&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_125">125</div>
<p>&ldquo;The poison of the prison atmosphere, noble
lady, is just as surely killing me as if it were real
poison. So again I implore you to let me go. Do
not degrade yourself by becoming a party to the
shameful conspiracy which has been planned against
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Abbess might have replied to Marie at
more length, but she was too thoroughly convinced
of the truth of her words and the injustice which
had been practised toward her to do so; and besides
this, Marie&rsquo;s sweetness of nature and childish ways
won more and more not only her sympathy but her
affection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot give you your freedom, my daughter,&rdquo;
she replied, &ldquo;but I will do all I can for you. You
may stay in the garden during the day, but when
the Bishop is here you will have to go back to the
prison. Perhaps mildness may accomplish more
than severity. It is because of this hope, bear in
mind, that I make this concession. Now go. Here
is the key to the garden.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie fervently kissed her hand and ran off.
The Abbess went to the window and thoughtfully
watched her. The joyful expression of her face
showed that her heart approved what her reason
and sense of duty half condemned.</p>
<p>Marie&rsquo;s life now grew more cheerful, for the
Abbess kept her word. She not only allowed her to
go daily to the garden, but she admitted her to her
confidence. Of course she had not the slightest
idea that this would induce her to join the order, but
she reasoned that if their relations became intimate
she would not suspect any such purpose.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_126">126</div>
<p>John of Luxemburg all this time was administering
affairs as if he were the lawful owner of Marie&rsquo;s
property, and so far ignored all her rights that after
deducting the comparatively small sum due to the
Bishop, he put the rest of the receipts into his
own pocket without further ceremony. It actually
seemed as if the two men little by little might
yet accomplish their purpose. Though Marie felt
very happy when she first set foot in the convent
garden and the Abbess treated her so affectionately,
yet the roses on her cheeks began to fade, and
when she was alone in her narrow prison during
the Bishop&rsquo;s visits her sorrowful sighs showed she
was not in her usual cheerful spirits. Even in the
garden her joyousness would vanish whenever she
came near the high wall which surrounded it. The
consciousness that she was a prisoner embittered
every joy, and at last even made the garden unenjoyable.
In this sad frame of mind the scenes of
her childhood seemed to her like bright spots in a
lost paradise. As she recalled the happiness of
that paradise, the more keenly she realized the injustice
which had driven her out of it. During
that day when all Rouen was witnessing the awful
spectacle in the old market-place, she sat more
sorrowful than usual in her prison. Of course she
did not know what was going on, for no news from
the outer world ever found its way within the convent
walls. Whatever the cause may have been,
whether her confinement this time had been longer
than usual, or whether she had painted the lost
happiness of her childhood in too lively colors, she
was more unhappy than usual.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_127">127</div>
<p>&ldquo;My God! My God!&rdquo; she moaned, &ldquo;hast
Thou utterly forsaken me? What crime have I
committed that calls for such a frightful expiation?
If I am guiltless why should godless men triumph?
And you, my uncle! Is it because you are dead
that your help is so long delayed? Oh! you brave
one, who all alone confronted those robbers in the
forest! Why wait you so long? Have you been
mistaken? Am I not the one for whom you dared
so much? Oh, be quiet, foolish heart, lest I persuade
myself I really am that one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She gradually regained her composure, smiled
through her tears, and lost herself in fancies of another
kind. At last, scared by her own thoughts,
she resumed: &ldquo;O thou Blessed Virgin, protect
him! Keep him far away from here. Those
against whom he would contend single-handed are
too strong for him. Protect him.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_128">128</div>
<p>As she spoke the last words there was a slight
noise at the door. &ldquo;They are coming to let me
out,&rdquo; she said to herself; &ldquo;the Bishop has gone.&rdquo;
She wiped away her tears and stepped forward.
The door opened, but it was a man&rsquo;s figure that she
saw in the dim light, not the sister keeper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it you, Marie of Chafleur?&rdquo; the stranger
whispered, for he could see nothing in the prison.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God! what is it? Who are you?&rdquo; said
the terrified girl in a low voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be quiet,&rdquo; whispered the stranger. &ldquo;If you are
Marie of Chafleur, take this bundle. It contains a
page&rsquo;s dress. Hasten! I will watch outside.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The poor girl trembled like an aspen leaf, but she
took the bundle. She stood for a few seconds as if
dazed, but quickly made her decision and stepped
back into the prison. It was some time before she
could make the change of costume, for her trembling
hands were not as deft as usual, but at last she went
out into the passage in her disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Give me all your clothes,&rdquo; whispered the stranger,
&ldquo;for if they are left here they will betray you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Marie fetched them to him, and after making a
bundle of them exactly like the one he had brought,
he took the trembling girl by the hand and led her
to the church door. Then he listened. All was
still. &ldquo;Softly, softly,&rdquo; he murmured as they left
the church.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_129">129</div>
<p>Who can picture Marie&rsquo;s glad surprise as she
looked by daylight into the face of her protector
for whose safety she had just before invoked the
Virgin? There was little time for sentiment, however,
for scarcely had Jean closed the door when
they heard voices and steps in the street. He drew
Marie down quickly, and they knelt together as if
engaged in their devotions, while he listened intently
to every sound near the entrance; but the steps
they had heard were those of passers-by. Jean
whispered, &ldquo;I believe we have succeeded. Let
us thank the Holy Virgin and Saint Ursula.&rdquo;
With tremulous voices they murmured their gratitude,
and then Jean said in a low tone: &ldquo;Do you
feel strong enough, noble lady, to go on alone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I will be as strong as a man when away,
far away from here,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will take the lead,&rdquo; said Jean. &ldquo;Follow me
at some little distance, so no one shall suspect we are
acquainted with each other. The whole city is in
commotion and crowded with strangers on account
of the execution. They will not pay much attention
to us. Do not look around much, lest some one
may recognize you. Keep your eyes downcast, and
they will think you have been overcome by the
dreadful spectacle. In this way we may pass through
the gate like the other strangers on their way home,
and after that the Holy Virgin will help us the rest
of the way.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_130">130</div>
<p>Jean arose and left the church, and Marie followed
his instructions. Everything turned out as
Jean had said. The two met many groups standing
on the walks or passing along the streets, and at
last safely got through the gate. Marie could
scarcely restrain her exultation, but Jean went calmly
on, hurrying to the forest as fast as she could follow
him. Marie&rsquo;s joy increased as she felt sure that
she was rescued, for she could not believe that a
trace had been left which would reveal the manner
of her escape. She looked around, and finding that
no one was following them, she gave expression to
her happiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My noble rescuer,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I cannot longer
keep silence and conduct myself like a Capuchin.
It is inconsistent with my costume, you know. I
must exult; I must shout, or I shall die right here
before you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not yet,&rdquo; said Jean, without turning round.
&ldquo;It is not the time for shouting, still less for dying.
We are not safe yet, though the most difficult part
of our undertaking has been accomplished. Your
exultation would be noticed from the city, and then
there would be much curiosity among the pages to
find out who it was that was so greatly pleased over
the horrible spectacle. During the next few days
they will move heaven and earth to catch the fugitive.
Then some one will be certain to remember
the exulting page of to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_131">131</div>
<p>Jean&rsquo;s advice made such an impression upon
Marie that she restrained herself; but when she
found herself within the shelter of the forest and
Jean waiting for her, she could no longer keep still.
She flew rather than ran over the green carpet.
Her feelings overcame her when for the first time
she found herself in Nature&rsquo;s majestic temple and
felt its subtle and mysterious magic. She fell upon
her knees and poured out a very passion of gratitude
to Heaven. She thanked the Virgin for the
happiness of which she had been so long deprived,
for her rescue, and especially for the protection
which had been given to her rescuer. Then she
turned to Jean, and her tearful eyes betrayed the
emotions of her heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no words with which to thank you,
gallant knight,&rdquo; said she.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, my noble lady,&rdquo; replied Jean, &ldquo;if you
only knew how happy it has made me to have
brought you thus far, you would think me recompensed
even too richly. But let us first think of
the joy this will bring to the noble La Hire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; exclaimed Marie, &ldquo;are you taking me
to La Hire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes! But let us hurry on, so that we may get
out of the English district before the news of your
flight is spread abroad.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_132">132</div>
<p>They went on again, and shortly met the peasants
with whom Jean had left his horse. He bought
another for Marie, and they rode off together. Once
more he safely travelled the dangerous road, and on
the next day they had passed the last city occupied
by the English. They met with no difficulties during
the rest of the journey, and after changing their
costumes at the lodgings in Chinon, Jean took
Marie to La Hire&rsquo;s apartment.</p>
<p>La Hire was not aware of their arrival at the inn.
He was greatly excited, for he had just heard the
news of Joan&rsquo;s death. Aroused to the highest pitch
of fury, he had cursed her enemies, then flung himself
into a chair, and seriously debated whether he
should not break his sword rather than serve such
a King longer. He was of too noble a nature, however,
to come to such a decision. There were enemies
of the fatherland yet to fight, and he had some other
duties to accomplish. He had just made his decision,
when he heard a well-known voice behind
him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, noble sir, is Marie of Chafleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The knight sprang up. Words cannot describe
his joy. He stood like a statue, with his eyes
fixed upon her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he exclaimed at last, &ldquo;is this charming
girl the little Marie, my sister&rsquo;s child?&rdquo; He opened
wide his arms, and she flew to his embrace. He
kissed her hair, and lovingly stroked her cheeks.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_133">133</div>
<p>&ldquo;My poor child,&rdquo; he gently said, &ldquo;how you
must have suffered!&rdquo; Marie only answered with a
sigh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall tell me all about it some other time.
Be quiet now, my daughter. From now on no one
shall harm a hair of your head. And this Luxemburg!
By Saint George, he shall make reparation
to me for every tear you have shed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He resumed his seat, and then turned to Jean.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come to my heart, my son. I knew that you were
as brave and determined and valiant as any one,
but I did not believe you would bring this child
back. I am anxious to know how you did it, but
just now I am too full under my doublet to listen.
I believe there are tears running down my beard. I
don&rsquo;t know when that ever happened before. It
must be because this is a real heart&rsquo;s joy you have
given me, my boy. Yes, yes, you and poor Joan
have both shown what resolute purpose can do when
it is persisted in to the end. Children,&rdquo; he exclaimed
to both of them, &ldquo;you have made me
young again. The end will be fine. Just now I
determined to fight the English still longer, and I
know,&rdquo; with a look at Jean, &ldquo;who will be with me.
But that is not the end I mean. That is only the
common duty. I know a finer end than that.&rdquo;
He looked with joyous eyes from Jean to Marie,
and from Marie to Jean. &ldquo;Yes, a finer end than
that, and by Saint George I will accomplish it.&rdquo;</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_134">134</div>
<p>The valiant knight did accomplish it. Just two
years from that day he stood on the steps of a
lordly castle, happier perhaps than he had ever been
before in his life, and watched a carriage which was
coming toward the castle amid the enthusiastic
shouts of the peasants. In this carriage the lawful
owner of the castle was making his entrance to take
possession, for the English had been driven out of
that whole region.</p>
<p>The master of the castle was Jean Renault,
and by his side sat his happy spouse, Marie of
Chafleur.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
